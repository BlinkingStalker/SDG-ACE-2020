## Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all".[2] The SDGs, set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and intended to be achieved by the year 2030, are part of UN Resolution 70/1, the 2030 Agenda.[3][4][5]

The Sustainable Development Goals are:

No Poverty
Zero Hunger
Good Health and Well-being
Quality Education
Gender Equality
Clean Water and Sanitation
Affordable and Clean Energy
Decent Work and Economic Growth
Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
Reducing Inequality
Sustainable Cities and Communities
Responsible Consumption and Production
Climate Action
Life Below Water
Life On Land
Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
Partnerships for the Goals

The goals are broad based and interdependent. The 17 sustainable development goals each has a list of targets which are measured with indicators. In an effort to make the SDGs successful, data on the 17 goals has been made available in an easily-understood form.[6] A variety of tools exist to track and visualize progress towards the goals.
