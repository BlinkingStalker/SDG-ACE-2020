439137100020,POLYMER,Cationic scavenging by polyaniline: Boon or bane from synthesis point of view of its nanocomposites,"This work establishes the fact that Polyaniline (PANI) contributes to cationic scavenging on the polymerization of a cross linking polymer, i.e. Divinylbenzene (DVB), resulting in a significant change in the properties of the PANI-based DVB resin system. Furthermore, it is also shown that the cationic scavenging is directly related to the degree of doping of PANI and its dispersion state. Various intermediate doped PANI was added with a fixed amount of DVB to prepare thermosetting matrices. The degree of doping of PANI was assessed with the DSC, FT-IR, and UV-VIS-NIR analyses before mixing with DVB matrix. It has been shown that the Polyaniline (PANI) agglomerates broke and a uniform dispersion was obtained with an increased degree of doping, which led to more exposed amines groups of PANI. These groups acted as scavengers to the cationic polymerization of the DVB monomer. DSC and viscosity measurement of the uncured PANI-DBSA/DVB resin system confirmed the scavenging effect of PANI on the curing profile and subsequently to the electrical and mechanical properties of the cured composites. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the scavenging behavior of PANI in the context of preparing PANI-based polymer composites. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

432369500007,TRAINING AND EDUCATION IN PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY,Ethics in Training and Training in Ethics: Special Considerations for Postdoctoral Fellowships in Health Service Psychology,"It is of great importance to the public and the profession to ensure that emerging professionals in health service psychology are competent to recognize and skillfully navigate ethical issues encountered in professional practice, and it is incumbent upon psychology training programs to accomplish this. Although postdoctoral fellowship is the final stage of formal training and supervision for many psychologists, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to delineating best practices for ethics training at the psychology postdoctoral level. Further, unique ethical considerations arise as postdoctoral supervisors engage in training an emerging colleague on the eve of ""career launch,"" seek to foster skills in complex situations while facilitating autonomy, and often embark on training in supervision itself. This article is intended to extend the scant literature and inform training practices by discussing ethics-focused topics particularly salient to both the content and process of postdoctoral level psychology training. Primary aims include addressing (a) the state of the field and current challenges, (b) designing training in ethics commensurate with the psychology postdoctoral level, (c) ethical issues encountered when supervising and mentoring trainees at the postdoctoral level, and (d) ethical issues in supervision of supervision. Consideration is given to the purpose of postdoctoral training as development of advanced and specialty competencies, as well as differentiation of postdoctoral training from levels earlier in the training sequence. Recommendations are provided for program directors who wish to expand or enhance ethics training, supervisors engaged in training postdoctoral fellows, future research, and next steps for the field."
423588500002,FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,Temporal Contiguity Training Influences Behavioral and Neural Measures of Viewpoint Tolerance,"Humans can often recognize faces across viewpoints despite the large changes in lowlevel image properties a shift in viewpoint introduces. We present a behavioral and an fMRI adaptation experiment to investigate whether this viewpoint tolerance is reflected in the neural visual system and whether it can be manipulated through training. Participants saw training sequences of face images creating the appearance of a rotating head. Half of the sequences showed faces undergoing veridical changes in appearance across the rotation (non-morph condition). The other half were non-veridical: during rotation, the face simultaneously morphed into another face. This procedure should successfully associate frontal face views with side views of the same or a different identity, and, according to the temporal contiguity hypothesis, thus enhance viewpoint tolerance in the non-morph condition and/or break tolerance in the morph condition. Performance on the same/different task in the behavioral experiment (N = 20) was affected by training. There was a significant interaction between training (associated/not associated) and identity (same/different), mostly reflecting a higher confusion of different identities when they were associated during training. In the fMRI study (N = 20), fMRI adaptation effects were found for same-viewpoint images of untrained faces, but no adaptation for untrained faces was present across viewpoints. Only trained faces which were not morphed during training elicited a slight adaptation across viewpoints in face-selective regions. However, both in the behavioral and in the neural data the effects were small and weak from a statistical point of view. Overall, we conclude that the findings are not inconsistent with the proposal that temporal contiguity can influence viewpoint tolerance, with more evidence for tolerance when faces are not morphed during training."
433225600002,QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL,Rapid switch in monsoon-wind induced surface hydrographic conditions of the eastern Arabian Sea during the last deglaciation,"Surface water hydrography in the Arabian Sea is primarily governed by the Asian monsoon wind system. Changes in the composition of fossil planktic foraminiferal assemblages and sea surface temperatures (SST) in sediment core SK17, retrieved from offshore of central India, are used to decipher past changes in sea-surface hydrographic conditions linked mainly to the winter monsoon winds. The planktic foraminiferal assemblage and the SST records indicate a rapid switch in sea-surface hydrographic conditions around 17.5 ka BP marking the end of last glacial period. The data show that intensified winter winds during 17.5-23.5 ka BP, resulted in nutrient injection into surface waters and eutrophic conditions, mainly through deep vertical mixing and/or moderate upwelling; and reduction in winter wind intensity caused stratification characterized by the high tropical SST since 17.5 ka BP. The timing of the rapid switch in seawater conditions caused by a drop in strength of winter monsoon winds is coeval with the cold climate excursion in the northern hemisphere (Heinrich Event 1), suggesting that the two areas are climatically linked."
426440700045,JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,Childhood Corporal Punishment and Future Perpetration of Physical Dating Violence,"Objective To test whether experiencing childhood corporal punishment is linked to later perpetration of dating violence. Study design Young adults (n = 758; 61% female; mean age of 20 years), originally recruited for a longitudinal study as 9th-and 10th-grade Texas high school students, were asked about their childhood experiences with corporal punishment and physical abuse, as well as current experiences with dating violence. A path model was used to determine whether childhood corporal punishment was related to recent perpetration of physical dating violence, while controlling for childhood physical abuse, age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results In all, 19% of participants (n = 134) reported physical dating violence perpetration and 68% reported experiencing corporal punishment as children (n = 498). Analysis showed a significant positive association between corporal punishment and physical perpetration of dating violence (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07-1.59). Even after controlling for sex, ethnicity, age, parental education, and child physical abuse, childhood corporal punishment was associated significantly with physical dating violence perpetration (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.62). Conclusions The finding that childhood corporal punishment was associated with perpetration of young adult physical dating violence, even after controlling for several demographic variables and childhood physical abuse, adds to the growing literature demonstrating deleterious outcomes associated with corporal punishment."
439102900019,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Portfolio Selection with Capital Gains Tax, Recursive Utility, and Regime Switching","Capital gains taxation has important implications for investors' portfolio choice decisions. To explore these implications, we develop a continuous time investment and consumption model with capital gains tax, Epstein-Zin recursive utility, and regime switching. We find that various factors, such as tax rate, risk aversion, interest rate, stock return, and volatility, jointly affect optimal portfolio allocation, whereas intertemporal substitution does not. In a regime switching market, investors may trade or stop trading purely because of a change in regime, and there is a distinct cross-regime effect on optimal portfolio allocation. In particular, investors tend to raise stock investment in a bear regime so as to reduce potential tax payments upon regime switching. Given reasonable parameter values, regime switching has a greater impact on optimal portfolio allocation in a bear regime than in a bull regime."

452070900010,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING,The ventricular residence time distribution derived from 4D flow particle tracing: a novel marker of myocardial dysfunction,"4D flow cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging allows visualisation of blood flow in the cardiac chambers and great vessels. Post processing of the flow data allows determination of the residence time distribution (RTD), a novel means of assessing ventricular function, potentially providing additional information beyond ejection fraction. We evaluated the RTD measurement of efficiency of left and right ventricular (LV and RV) blood flow. 16 volunteers and 16 patients with systolic dysfunction (LVEF<50%) underwent CMR studies including 4D flow. The RTDs were created computationally by seeding virtual particles' at the inlet plane in customised post-processing software, moving these particles with the measured blood velocity, recording and counting how many exited per unit of time. The efficiency of ventricular flow was determined from the RTDs based on the time constant (RTDc=-1/B) of the exponential decay. The RTDc was compared to ejection fraction, T1 mapping and global longitudinal strain (GLS). There was a significant difference between groups in LV RTDc (healthy volunteers 1.2 +/- 0.13 vs systolic dysfunction 2.2 +/- 0.80, p<0.001, C-statistic=1.0) and RV RTDc (1.5 +/- 0.15 vs 2.0 +/- 0.57, p=0.013, C-statistic=0.799). The LV RTDc correlated significantly with LVEF (R=-0.84, P<0.001) and the RV RTDc had significant correlation with RVEF (R=-0.402, p=0.008). The correlation between LV RTDc and LVEF was similar to GLS and LVEF (0.926, p<0.001). The ventricular residence time correlates with ejection fraction and can distinguish normal from abnormal systolic function. Further assessment of this method of assessment of chamber function is warranted."

453914700005,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE,An adaptive arm's mechanical impedance estimator for rehabilitation robots without force and acceleration sensors,"The mechanical impedance of the human arm can be measured to quantitatively assess the motor function. In this paper, an adaptive least square estimation method is proposed for online measurement of the mechanical impedance of the arm, without force or acceleration sensors, which extremely reduces the expenses and complexity of rehabilitation robots. The proposed strategy may also be used for monitoring the dynamic changes of the mechanical impedance. Estimation of timevarying force is also the other capability of the algorithm. The closed-loop stability of the system is analytically shown using the Lyapunov stability theorem. To show the applications of the proposed scheme, two main scenarios are described which can be used for the rehabilitation robots to assess the motor recovery of the patients undergoing the rehabilitation sessions. To validate the scheme, a 2-DOF manipulator is adopted to illustrate the accuracy of the impedance and force estimations in noiseless and noisy conditions."
444789300041,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY,Mass transport limitation in inlet periphery of fuel cells: Studied on a planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cell,"It was recently clarified on a microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) that the range of mass transport limitation might commence from the inlet periphery (inlet opening and inlet pipe), i.e., the concentration gradient of reactants may extend inward the inlet periphery. For demonstrating that this phenomenon occurs regardless of the form and type of the fuel cell operating at high reactant utilization rate, herein we investigate the mass transport in the anode side of a one-cell stack of a planar SOFC. The investigation leans upon experimental and numerical data analyzed from both conventional (non spatial) and spatial perspectives. The experimental data were spatially obtained in the lateral direction by applying the segmentation method. Regarding analyses let us to confirm that mass transport limitation occurs in the inlet periphery of the planar stack. Besides, the critical ratio of the consumed/supplied mass fluxes of hydrogen is valid for assessing whether the concentration gradient of hydrogen extends inward the inlet periphery. Furthermore, the virtual inlet opening is useful for accurately calculating the mass transport within the active field of the stack via hypothetically preventing the mass transport limitation in the inlet periphery. These findings are expected to help researchers and engineers for accurately designing and characterizing fuel cell systems at varying scales from cells to stacks.

453667100002,FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,Neuroanatomy- and Pathology-Based Functional Examinations of Experimental Stroke in Rats: Development and Validation of a New Behavioral Scoring System,"In experimental stroke studies, a neuroanatomy-based functional examination of behaviors is critical to predict the pathological extent of infarcts because brain-imaging studies are not always available. However, there is a lack of systematic studies to examine the efficiency of a behavioral test for this purpose. Our work aimed to design a new score for this goal in stroke rats, by simplifying the Garcia score (with subscore 1-6) and adding circling as subscore 7. MRI and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining were used to determine the pathological extent after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The modified summations of subscores were designed according to the predictability of each subscore for locations and sizes of infarcts in one group of stroke rats, and were validated in another group. The original Garcia score was able to predict the pathological extent of edema-adjusted infarct size >= 30%, and the summation of subscore 4, 6, and 7 (4: climbing, 6: vibrissae sensation, 7: circling) also could predict it well. The original Garcia score failed to predict infarct at the primary motor cortex, while the summation of subscore 4, 6, and 7 potentially could predict not only the primary motor cortex, but also the forelimb, hindlimb, and barrel field regions of the primary sensory cortex. Accordingly, this neuroanatomy-correlated functional assessment system composed of subscore 4, 6, and 7 was proposed, with less examination time and better inter-rater reliability than the original Garcia score. In summary, this new scoring system, summation (4,6,7) score, examined motor and sensory functions based on neuroanatomical involvement, having the potential to predict the pathological extent and specific relevant brain areas of infarcts, respectively."
422912100061,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Large room-temperature tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance and electroresistance in single ferromagnet/Nb:SrTiO3 Schottky devices,"There is a large effort in research and development to realize electronic devices capable of storing information in new ways - for instance devices which simultaneously exhibit electro and magnetoresistance. However it remains a challenge to create devices in which both effects coexist. In this work we show that the well-known electroresistance in noble metal-Nb:SrTiO3 Schottky junctions can be augmented by a magnetoresistance effect in the same junction. This is realized by replacing the noble metal electrode with ferromagnetic Co. This magnetoresistance manifests as a room temperature tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR). The maximum room temperature TAMR (1.6%) is significantly larger and robuster with bias than observed earlier, not using Nb:SrTiO3. In a different set of devices, a thin amorphous AlOx interlayer inserted between Co and Nb:SrTiO3, reduces the TAMR by more than 2 orders of magnitude. This points to the importance of intimate contact between the Co and Nb:SrTiO3 for the TAMR effect. This is explained by electric field enhanced spin-orbit coupling of the interfacial Co layer in contact with Nb:SrTiO3. We propose that the large TAMR likely has its origin in the 3d orbital derived conduction band and large relative permittivity of Nb:SrTiO3 and discuss ways to further enhance the TAMR."
418984700005,JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS,On reliable communication in transmit-only networks for home automation,"Home-automation applications such as intelligent illumination, heating, and ventilation allow reducing the overall energy consumption and improve comfort in our everyday lives. To implement such applications, multiple sensors and actuators often need to be connected into networks typically communicating over radio signals, i.e., wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Many available technologies are based on bidirectional devices with the capability of acknowledging packets and performing retransmissions if necessary. However, home-automation devices mostly report data to a sink for which they do not need any feedback channel or external control, thus, unidirectional devices can be used instead reducing costs and energy consumption. On the other hand, since unidirectional nodes are unable to perform carrier sensing or acknowledge packets, the resulting networks are often unreliable. To overcome this problem, we propose a medium access control (MAC) that consists in making each transmit-only node send a sequence of redundant packets. The proposed method guarantees reliability, i.e., at least one packet of each sequence reaches its destination within a specified deadline by carefully selecting inter-packet times. In contrast to similar approaches from the literature, our MAC is based on a more general model that allows describing arbitrary deadlines and packet sizes for each node in the network and can accommodate considerably more nodes into a reliable network as the ratio between the longest and the shortest deadline increases. We illustrate these and other benefits of the proposed MAC by means of extensive simulations based on the OMNeT++ framework."
454972000165,TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS,Successful Treatment of the Gastrointestinal Manifestation of Prototheca in a Kidney Transplant Recipient: A Case Report,"Introduction. The Prototheca species are achlorophyllic algae and they are recognized pathogens in animals. They have been reported to cause infections in humans; the majority of the infected patients are immunocompromised. Organ transplant recipients are at risk of infection caused by such unusual organisms. The case. Here we present a highly atypical case report of Prototheca mimicking a cecum tumor in a kidney recipient 7 years after the transplantation. Three years before this Prototheca infection, after a native nephrectomy, the patient underwent a complicated duodeno-jejunal reconstruction with feeding catheter jejunostomy. Imaging studies indicated a tumor-like space occupying lesion in the cecum. The patient was treated successfully with colon resection. Detailed histology excluded malignancy and proved Prototheca wickerhamii. Discussion. The pathogenesis and many biological aspects of human protothecosis are unclear. Usually, treatment involves both medical and surgical approaches. The surgical treatment should be complete excision. The literature suggests an extremely high mortality rate, and therefore we advocate aggressive surgery in organ transplant recipients. This case is the first report of a successfully treated gastrointestinal manifestation of protothecosis in an organ transplant recipient."
423238700001,MEMOIRS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY,Tensor Products and Regularity Properties of Cuntz Semigroups,"The Cuntz semigroup of a C*-algebra is an important invariant in the structure and classification theory of C*-algebras. It captures more information than K-theory but is often more delicate to handle. We systematically study the lattice and category theoretic aspects of Cuntz semigroups. Given a C*-algebra A, its (concrete) Cuntz semigroup Cu(A) is an object in the category Cu of (abstract) Cuntz semigroups, as introduced by Coward, Elliott and Ivanescu (2008). To clarify the distinction between concrete and abstract Cuntz semigroups, we will call the latter Cu-semigroups. We establish the existence of tensor products in the category Cu and study the basic properties of this construction. We show that Cu is a symmetric, monoidal category and relate Cu(A circle times B) with Cu(A) circle times(Cu) Cu(B) for certain classes of C*-algebras. As a main tool for our approach we introduce the category W of pre-completed Cuntz semigroups. We show that Cu is a full, reflective subcategory of W. One can then easily deduce properties of Cu from respective properties of W, for example the existence of tensor products and inductive limits. The advantage is that constructions in W are much easier since the objects are purely algebraic. For every (local) C*-algebra A, the classical Cuntz semigroup W(A) together with a natural auxiliary relation is an object of W. This defines a functor from C*-algebras to W which preserves inductive limits. We deduce that the assignment A -> Cu(A) defines a functor from C*-algebras to Cu which preserves inductive limits. This generalizes a result from Coward, Elliott, and Ivanescu (2008). We also develop a theory of Cu-semirings and their semimodules. The Cuntz semigroup of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra has a natural product giving it the structure of a Cu-semiring. For C*-algebras, it is an important regularity property to tensorially absorb a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra. Accordingly, it is of particular interest to analyse the tensor products of Cu-semigroups with the Cu-semiring of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra. This leads us to define 'solid' Cu-semirings (adopting the terminology from solid rings), as those Cu-semirings S for which the product induces an isomorphism between S circle times(Cu) S and S. This can be considered as an analog of being strongly self-absorbing for Cu-semirings. As it turns out, if a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra satisfies the UCT, then its Cu-semiring is solid. We prove a classification theorem for solid Cu-semirings. This raises the question of whether the Cuntz semiring of every strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra is solid. If R is a solid Cu-semiring, then a Cu-semigroup S is a semimodule over R if and only if R circle times(Cu) S is isomorphic to S. Thus, analogous to the case for C*-algebras, we can think of semimodules over R as Cu-semigroups that tensorially absorb R. We give explicit characterizations when a Cu-semigroup is such a semimodule for the cases that R is the Cu-semiring of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra satisfying the UCT. For instance, we show that a Cu-semigroup S tensorially absorbs the Cu-semiring of the Jiang-Su algebra if and only if S is almost unperforated and almost divisible, thus establishing a semigroup version of the Toms-Winter conjecture."

Study design The Transition Home Plus (THP) program incorporated enhanced support services before and after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) provided by social workers and family resource specialists (trained peers) working with the medical team from October 2012 to October 2014. Rhode Island Medicaid claims data were used to study the 321 infants cared for in the NICU for >= 5 days, who were enrolled in the THP program. THP infants were compared with a historical comparison group of 365 high-risk infants born and admitted to the same NICU in 2011 before the full launch of the THP program. Intervention and comparison group outcomes were compared in the eight 3-month quarters after the infant's birth. Propensity score weights were applied in regression models to balance demographic characteristics between groups. Results Infants in the intervention group had significantly lower total Medicaid spending, fewer emergency department visits, and fewer readmissions than the comparison group. Medicaid spending savings for the intervention group were $4591 per infant per quarter in our study period. Conclusions Transition home support services for high-risk infants provided both in the NICU and for 90 days after discharge by social workers and family resource specialists working with the medical team can reduce Medicaid spending and health care use."

A series of numerical experiments is performed so as to systematically evaluate the emergent properties of media containing microcracks swarms with predefined intensities and orientations. Emphasis is put on the apparent Young's modulus, tensile strength and fracture toughness. Microcracks swarms reduce the strength of materials, affect their overall brittleness and induce anisotropic behavior. They also directly influence the initiation and propagation of mode I fractures which can deviate from their expected path as a result of branching."

Pain was assessed using a 0-10 numeric rating scale. Development of new or progression of pre-existing fractures and local tumor progression (LTP) were determined on follow-up imaging. Pain score reduction and fracture development rates were compared by ablation completeness and the presence of pre-existing fractures.ResultsTwenty-three of 27 (85%) patients with evaluable pain scores had reduced pain, decreasing from 7.5 +/- 2.1 to 3.6 +/- 2.6 (p<0.0001). Of 39 tumors, 28 (72%) were completely ablated with no significant difference in pain reduction after complete versus incomplete ablations (p=0.9387). Six of 30 (20%) patients with follow-up imaging demonstrated new/progressive acetabular fractures. Four of 5 (80%) patients with LTP developed new/progressive fractures compared to 2 of 25 (8%) without tumor progression (p=0.0003). Pre-existing fracture was not associated with subsequent fracture/fracture progression (p=0.2986). However, patients with prior acetabular radiation therapy or surgery had increased fractures following treatment (p=0.0380).Conclusion Complete acetabular tumor ablation during CCC was not associated with superior pain relief compared to subtotal ablation but did result in improved fracture stabilization. Pre-treatment pathologic fractures were not associated with fracture progression, but new/progressive fractures were more frequent in patients with prior radiation therapy or surgery."

The thermochemical behavior of the raw materials was a function of their composition and inorganic content. Olive pomace had a low ash content, a high volatile content and a low moisture. Moreover, olive pomace presented the highest reactivity. On the other hand, olive pomace presented the highest H-2, CO, CO2, CH4 and NO emissions, while the highest SO2 release was obtained with petcoke, showing the output stream coming from the gasification of coal the highest H-2/CO ratio. The presence of olive pomace in the blends improved their reactivity, increased the H-2 release and the H-2/CO ratio, and decreased the CO yield. A synergistic effect was observed in the gasification of the binary blend of olive pomace and petcoke. On the contrary, the gasification of the binary blend of olive pomace and coal presented an antagonistic effect. In ternary blends, either ssynergistic or antagonistic effects were observed, which depended on raw materials ratios in the feed. Finally, the lower the olive pomace ratio in the blends, the higher the porosity of the remaining residue was."
427420100028,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT,Efficient Action Computation for Compositional SDN Policies,"Software-defined networking envisions the support of multiple applications collaboratively operating on the same traffic. Policies of applications therefore require composition into a rule list that represents the union of application intents. In this context, ensuring the correctness and efficiency of composition for match fields as well as the associated actions is the fundamental requirement. Prior work however focuses only on the composition of match fields and assumes simple concatenation for action composition. We show in this paper that simple concatenation can result in incorrect behavior and inefficiency of packet processing. To address this issue, we formalize the action composition problem and propose two graph-based computation models to facilitate efficient composition of action lists. Our proposed approach has been integrated into the CoVisor code base and the evaluation results show its fitness for purpose."
450992300017,TECTONICS,Coseismic Slip Vectors of 24 August and 30 October 2016 Earthquakes in Central Italy: Oblique Slip and Regional Kinematic Implications,"After 24 August and 30 October 2016 central Italy earthquakes (Mw 6.0 and 6.5, respectively), photogrammetry and geodetic survey were performed at various sites along a 6-km-long portion of the rupturing Monte Vettore fault system, providing very high-resolution georeferenced 3-D point clouds and imagery of the 24 August rupture and a data set of bedrock fault scarp before/after the 30 October earthquake. The maximum coseismic displacement for both events occurs near Scoglio dell' Aquila with an average normal dip slip of 224 and 18 +/- 46 cm, respectively. Coseismic slip vectors and meter-scale corrugation axis are oriented N280 +/- 10 degrees on the similar to N140 degrees striking main Vettore fault involving oblique normal slip with a right-lateral component and N205 +/- 10 degrees on similar to N170 degrees fault strands implying oblique normal slip with a left-lateral component. We quantify the near-field coseismic displacements of the Monte Vettore fault for the 30 October event: the footwall has been translated horizontally by 42 +/- 2 cm toward the ENE and uplifted by 11 +/- 2 cm. The hangingwall has moved horizontally by 26 +/- 2 cm, toward the NW, in a direction parallel to the fault plane and subsided by 116 +/- 2 cm. The fault geometry and our determined surface coseismic slip vectors are mechanically compatible with a sigma 3 = N65 +/- 15 degrees. This stress regime is consistent with the 30 October 2016 focal mechanism and the relative motion between the Adriatic microplate and the Tyrrhenian coastal region. The 30 October surface rupture results from seismic slip at depth and thus has a tectonic origin. Plain Language Summary After 24 August and 30 October 2016 central Italy earthquakes, we acquire a very high-resolution data set of the effect of the fault at the surface before and after the 30 October earthquake. Those data sets allow quantifying the motion of each compartment on both side of the fault during the earthquake and the direction of this motion. The footwall has been translated horizontally by 42 +/- 2 cm toward the ENE and uplifted by 11 +/- 2 cm. The hangingwall has moved horizontally by 26 +/- 2 cm, toward the NW, and subsided by 116 +/- 2 cm. These results are consistent with the seismic data and suggest that surface ruptures observed are resulting from seismic slip at depth."

Qualitative methods were employed to explore the attitudes and opinions of members of the New Zealand public with varying levels of community safety in respect to the treatment of youth offenders. Results indicate those who identified as lowest in levels of safety were more punitive in their opinions, though they also expressed a firm desire for progressive treatment options such as rehabilitation and taking preventative action. Those who felt the safest in their community were less likely to be punitive in their opinions towards youth offenders."
443233300034,JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON,Inter-cortical modulation from premotor to motor plasticity,"Primary motor cortex (M1) plasticity is known to be influenced by the excitability and prior activation history of M1 itself. However, little is known about how its plasticity is influenced by other areas of the brain. In the present study on humans of either sex who were known to respond to theta burst stimulation from previous studies, we found plasticity of M1 could be modulated by suppressing the premotor cortex with the theta burst form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Motor plasticity was distorted and disappeared 30 min and 120 min, respectively, after premotor excitability was suppressed. Further evaluation revealed that such changes in motor plasticity were associated with impaired learning of a simple motor task. We postulate that the premotor cortex modulates the amount of plasticity within M1 through heterosynaptic metaplasticity, and that this may impact on learning of a simple motor task previously shown to be directly affected by M1 plasticity. The present results provide an insight into how the brain physiologically coordinates two different areas to bring them into a functional network. Furthermore, such concepts could be translated into therapeutic approaches for diseases with aberrant plasticity."
430684600029,CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES,Rigorous Clinical Trial Design in Public Health Emergencies Is Essential,"Randomized clinical trials are the most reliable approaches to evaluating the effects of new treatments and vaccines. During the 2014-2015 West African Ebola epidemic, many argued that such trials were neither ethical nor feasible in an environment of limited health infrastructure and severe disease with a high fatality rate. Consensus among the numerous organizations providing help to the affected areas was never achieved, resulting in fragmented collaboration, delayed study initiation, and ultimately failure to provide definitive evidence on the efficacy of treatments and vaccines. Randomized trials were in fact approved by local ethics boards and initiated, demonstrating that randomized trials, even in such difficult circumstances, are feasible. Improved planning and collaboration among research and humanitarian organizations, and affected communities, in the interepidemic periods are needed to ensure that questions regarding the efficacy of vaccines and treatments can be definitively answered during future public health emergencies."
443684400020,INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL,Association of obstructive sleep apnoea with acute severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation: a population-based study,Little is known about the association of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) with the severity of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). This retrospective cohort study investigated the association of coexistent OSA with acute severity markers (i.e. invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) use and hospital length of stay (LOS)) among adults hospitalised for AECOPD. Patients with coexistent OSA had a significantly higher risk of IPPV use and prolonged hospital LOS compared to those without OSA.
447190700002,EARLY MEDIEVAL CHINA,"Miracle Tales as Scripture Reception: A Case Study Involving the Lotus Sutra in China, 370-750 CE","Reception theory argues that meaning resides not in texts but in readers' encounters with them. What would it mean to take this notion seriously in limning the authority and power Buddhist sutras were regarded as possessing in pre-Song China? In addition to the usual suspects (commentaries and doctrinal discourses), we have copious quantities of texts belonging to a pair of genres that have not been sufficiently examined as evidence for how sutras were received there: so-called miracle tales and biographies. Using narratives concerning the Lotus Sutra as examples, this article is a preliminary inquiry into the modes of sutra reception these works provide evidence of and themselves constituted. Ultimately, many people of most social strata saw sutras not just as doctrine delivery devices but as living entities, powerful platforms for activating divine responses to earnest devotional action. In construing the sutras in this way, Chinese people were not misreading the sutras: instead, they were taking seriously the promises and self-statements made in them."
449072900017,JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME,Central Coalition Osteotomy of Phalangeal Synostoses in the Management of the Type III Apert Hand,"Purpose We report a technique in the management of the type III Apert hand. The proposed approach facilitates the creation of a 5-fingered hand in 3 stages. Methods We reviewed records of patients with Apert syndrome and type III hands surgically treated at our institution from 1995 through 2014. In all cases, syndactyly release was performed in 3 stages with prioritization of the border digits. In addition, limited retrograde, axial osteotomies between the phalangeal segments of the conjoined index, middle, and ring fingers were performed during the first stage. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, clinical presentation, operative findings, and postoperative outcomes. Results Twelve pediatric patients with type III hands underwent syndactyly release. Median patient age was 10.0, 15.8, and 29.6 months at operative stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A thumb and 4 fingers were achieved for all but 1 hand. The median duration of hospital stay was 2 days for each stage. No infections or major complications were observed. Conclusions We demonstrate this method as a safe and effective means of creating 5 digits in the Apert patient with type III hands. Our opinion is that the additional aesthetic and functional gains offset the requirement of a 3-stage approach. Copyright (C) 2018 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

445105800014,MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING,A novel neural electrode with micro-motion-attenuation capability based on compliant mechanismsphysical design concepts and evaluations,"In order to solve the problem of the short lifespan of the neural electrode caused by micro motion, this study designed a novel neural electrode based on lumped compliance compliant mechanism to control different modes of micro-motion in a more effective way. According to the mathematical modeling of the novel neural electrode, the equivalent bending stiffness and equivalent tensile (compression) stiffness were calculated. The results of the finite element analysis based on the mathematical modeling revealed that the novel neural electrode showed excellent micro-motion-attenuation capability. The static analysis results showed that the novel design dramatically reduced the maximum displacement of the brain in 51% and the maximum stress in 41% under longitudinal micro-motion environment. It also effectively reduced the 5.1% maximum stress while maintaining the maximum displacement under lateral micro-motion environment. The experimental results based on the tissue injury evaluation system also confirmed that the novel electrode is more effective in micro-motion attenuation than the reference one. In detail, the strain of the brain tissue caused by the implantation of the neural electrode was decreased by 1.26 to 27.84% at the insertion depth of 3mm, and 0.522 to 17.24% at the insertion depth of 4.5mm, which has convinced the effectiveness of the design."
446762900001,FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,"Sex-Dependent Effects of Environmental Enrichment on Spatial Memory and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Signaling in a Developmental ""Two-Hit"" Mouse Model Combining BDNF Haploinsufficiency and Chronic Glucocorticoid Stimulation","Neurodevelopmental disorders are thought to be caused by a combination of adverse genetic and environmental insults. The ""two-hit"" hypothesis suggests that an early first ""hit"" primes the developing brain to be vulnerable to a second ""hit"" during adolescence which triggers behavioral dysfunction. We have previously modeled this scenario in mice and found that the combined effect of a genetic hapolinsuffuciency in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene (1st hit) and chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment during adolescence (2nd hit), caused spatial memory impairments in adulthood. Environmental enrichment (EE) protocols are designed to stimulate experience-dependent plasticity and have shown therapeutic actions. This study investigated whether EE can reverse these spatial memory impairments. Wild-type (WT) and BDNF heterozygous (HET) mice were treated with corticosterone (CORT) in their drinking water (50 mg/L) from weeks 6 to 8 and exposed to EE from 7 to 9 weeks. Enriched housing included open top cages with additional toys, tunnels, housing, and platforms. Y-maze novel preference testing, to assess short-term spatial memory, was performed at 10 weeks of age. At week 16 dorsal hippocampus tissue was obtained for Western blot analysis of expression levels of BDNF, the BDNF receptor TrkB, and NMDA receptor subunits, GluNR1, 2A and 2B. As in our previous studies, spatial memory was impaired in our two-hit (BDNF HET + CORT) mice. Simultaneous EE prevented these impairments. However, EE appeared to worsen spatial memory performance in WT mice, particularly those exposed to CORT. While BDNF levels were lower in BDNF HET mice as expected, there were no further effects of CORT or EE in males but a close to significant female CORT x EE x genotype interaction which qualitatively corresponded with Y-maze performance. However, EE caused both sex- and genotype-specific effects on phosphorylated TrkB residues and GluNR expression within the dorsal hippocampus, with GluNR2B levels in males changing in parallel with spatial memory performance. In conclusion, beneficial effects of EE on spatial memory emerge only following two developmental disruptions. The mechanisms by which EE exerts its effects are likely via regulation of multiple activity-dependent pathways, including TrkB and NMDA receptor signaling."
444420200005,JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY,Measurement of circulating transcript levels (NETest) to detect disease recurrence and improve follow-up after curative surgical resection of well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors,"Background: Recurrence of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) after surgery is common. Strategies to detect recurrence have limitations. We investigated the role of clinical criteria and the multigene polymerase chain reaction-based NETest during post-operative follow-up of pNET. Methods: We studied 3 groups of resections: R0 with no recurrence (n=11), R0 with recurrence (n=12), and R1 with no recurrence (n=12). NETest levels (>40%) were compared with chromogranin A (CgA) and clinicopathological criteria (CC; grade, lymph node metastases, size). Nonparametric, receiver operating characteristics, logistic regression, and predictive feature importanceanalyses were performed. Results: NETest was higher in R0 with recurrence (568%) compared with R1 with no recurrence (39 +/- 6%) and R0 with no recurrence (28 +/- 6%, P<.005). NETest positively correlated with recurrence (area under the curve: 0.82), CgA was not (area under the curve: 0.51 +/- 0.09). Multiple regression analysis defined factor impact as highest for NETest (P<.005) versus CC (P<.03) and CgA (P=.23). NETest gave false positive or negative recurrence in 18% using a 40% cutoff. Logistic regression modeling of CC was 83% accurate; it was 91% when the NETest was included. Combining CC and NETest was approximately 2x more effective than individual CC alone (increase in R-2 value from 43% to 80%). Conclusions: A multigene blood test facilitates effective identification of pNET recurrence, prediction of disease relapse, and outperforms CgA."
451028600007,RESEARCH IN MICROBIOLOGY,Real-time assessment of bacteriophage T3-derived antimicrobial activity against planktonic and biofilm-embedded Escherichia coli by isothermal microcalorimetry,"Bacterial biofilms, highly resistant to the conventional antimicrobial therapy, remain an unresolved challenge pressing the medical community to investigate new and alternative strategies to fight chronic implant-associated infections. Recently, strictly lytic bacteriophages have been revalued as powerful agents to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria even in biofilm. Here, the interaction of T3 bacteriophage and planktonic and biofilm Escherichia coli TG1, respectively, was evaluated using isothermal microcalorimetry. Microcalorimetry is a non-invasive and highly sensitive technique measuring growth-related heat production of microorganisms in real-time. Planktonic and biofilm E. coli TG1 were exposed to different titers of T3 bacteriophage, ranging from 10(2) to 10(7) PFU/ml. The incubation of T3 with E. coli TG1 showed a strong inhibition of heat production both in planktonic and biofilm already at lower bacteriophage titers (10(3) PFU/ml). This method could be used to screen and evaluate the antimicrobial potential of different bacteriophages, alone and in combination with antibiotics in order to improve the treatment success of biofilm-associated infections.

427213100024,JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS,"Effect of boiling on protein, mineral, dietary fibre and antinutrient compositions of Nymphaea lotus (Linn) seeds","The effect of boiling as a processing method on some of the nutrient compositions of raw and processed Nymphaea lotus seeds was assessed, the proximate analysis shows that raw and processed N. lotus contain 16.3 and 15.8% crude protein, 3.70 and 3.45% crude lipid, 1.87 and 0.70% ash content,. The protein of both samples contains all the essential amino acids, and satisfies the score recommended by FAO/WHO/UNU (2007). The in vitro assay for protein digestibility was found to be 76.9% and 69.6% for raw and processed N. lotus seeds, respectively. Mineral contents of N. lotus seeds were higher than those of conventional foods such as sorghum grain and millet. Thus, processed N. lotus seeds of average weight of 30 g can meet the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of iron for children of 1-3 years, 9-13 years, and adults of 51-70 years; and that of raw can provide 85% of the RDA for these age groups. The processing significantly reduces the level of heat labile antinutrients (Oxalate, Trypsin and Chymotrypsin). In conclusion, this nutrient dense seeds can be recommended as a complement for foods of plant origin."
432167300005,JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS,Release velocities and bowler performance in cricket,"There is a widespread notion in the cricketing world that with increasing pace the performance of a bowler improves. Additionally, many cricket experts believe faster bowlers to be more effective against lower order batters than bowlers who bowl at slower speeds. The present study puts these two ubiquitous notions under test by statistically analysing the differences in performance of bowlers from three subpopulations based on average release velocities. Results from one-way ANOVA (and its modified versions), for international test matches, reveal faster bowlers to be performing better, in terms of Average and Strike-rate, but no significant differences in the Economy rate and Dynamic Bowling rate. Faster bowlers were found to be more effective in taking wickets of lower and middle order batters as compared to bowlers with less pace. However, there was no statistically significant difference in performance of Fast and Fast-Medium bowlers against a top-order batter."
428823500007,APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES,Pressure dependence of X-rays produced by an LiTaO3 single crystal over a wide range of pressure,"The energy spectra of X-rays produced by an LiTaO3 single crystal have been measured at the pressures of 8 x 10(-4) - 4 Pa. The energy spectra showed that the endpoint energy steadily increased with decrease of pressure at 2-4 Pa and gradually decreased with decrease of pressure at 0.1-2 Pa, and became almost constant below 0.1 Pa. The amount of X-rays steadily increased with decrease of pressure at 2-4 Pa and almost saturated below 0.5 Pa. The change off X-rays produced by the LiTaO3 single crystal was compared with the previous works and discussed in relation to the distance between the crystal surface and the target."
444358000013,BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS,A solid ionic Lactate biosensor using doped graphene-like membrane of Au-EVIMC-titania nanotubes-polyaniline,"Herein, a doped graphene-like membrane was designed, which was copolymerized to be a solid ionic biosensor by using titania nanotubes (TiNTs), polyaniline (PANI), EvimCl (1-ethyl-3-vinylimidazolium chloride, EVIMC) and chloroauric acid (HAuCl4). The structure of graphene-like arrangement and the copolymerization mechanism of the film were discussed in detail. Because of the high catalytic property, Lactate could be determined on the membrane catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) containing isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)), which was immobilized onto the film by electrostatic attraction. The electrochemical response on the LDH/Au-EVIMC-TiNTs-PANI/ITO was increased by twice than the LDH/TiNTs/PANI/ITO, and exhibited two linear responses within the concentration range from 5.5 x 10(-7) M to 5.55 x 10(-6) M, and 5.55 x 10(-6) M to 3.33 x 10(-3) M, with a detection limit of 1.65 x 10(-7) M (S / N = 3). The interference study for other common coexistence such as uric acid and hemoglobin revealed that there was no overlapping signal for the detection of Lactate on the biosensor. The developed method proved the most stability in the determination of real blood samples, and the recoveries ranged from 96.7% to 105.8% with a satisfactory result."
426346300010,INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE,Leucine-Rich alpha-2-Glycoprotein-1 (LRG-1) Expression in Retinoblastoma,"PURPOSE. Retinoblastomas' growth rate is dependent on their ability to induce neovascularization. Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG-1) was recently reported to be upregulated in human retinal disease with neovascular pathology. The purpose of the study was to determine LRG-1 expression in human retinoblastoma and to correlate it with clinical and histopathologic parameters and to assess how its expression correlates with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. METHODS. LRG-1 expression was immunohistochemically evaluated in 34 retinoblastoma sections. Immunofluorescence for LRG-1/VEGF-A, LRG-1/TGF-beta 1/CD31, and LRG-1/Ki67 was performed. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis for the expression of LRG-1 was also done. RESULTS. LRG-1 was found to be extensively and robustly expressed in retinoblastoma tumors (88%) irrespective of the degree of invasiveness, differentiation, iris neovascularization, and anterior segment involvement. LRG-1 immunoreactivity was predominantly observed in the central tumor vasculature and in the surrounding rim of ischemia. The higher frequency of LRG-1 expression in the presence of optic nerve infiltration, vitreous seeding, and necrosis was not statistically significant. Colocalization was observed between LRG-1 and VEGF-A staining, and no difference in their counts was detected. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that LRG-1 gene expression was significantly upregulated (4.8-fold increase, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. LRG-1 was highly expressed in human retinoblastoma sections, thus providing new insights into the molecular mechanism of retinoblastoma pathogenesis, and suggests a possible new therapeutic target. LRG-1 is a novel oncogene-associated protein shown to be vital to the progression of human cancers. Inhibiting tumor vasculature is progressively evolving as a target in anticancer therapy."
432721000001,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,"Drug prescribing during pregnancy in a central region of Italy, 2008-2012","Background: Drug consumption during pregnancy is a matter of concern, especially regarding drugs known or suspected to be teratogens. Little is known about drug use in pregnant women in Italy. The present study is aimed at examining the prevalence, and to detect potential inappropriateness of drug prescribing among pregnant women in Latium, a region of central Italy. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on a cohort of women aged 18-45 years who delivered between 2008 and 2012 in public hospitals. Women were enrolled through the Regional Birth Register. After linking the regional Health Information Systems and the Regional Drug Claims Register, women's clinical data and prescribed medications were analyzed. Italian Medicine Agency (AIFA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evidence were used to investigate inappropriate prescribing and teratogenic risk. Results: Excluding vitamins and minerals, 80.6% (n = 153,079) of the women were prescribed at least one drug during pregnancy, with an average of 4.6 medications per pregnancy. Drugs for blood and hematopoietic organs were the most commonly prescribed (53.0%,), followed by anti-infectives for systemic use (50.7%). Among the inappropriate prescriptions, progestogen supplementation was given in 20.1% of pregnancies; teratogen drugs were prescribed in 0.8%, mostly angiotensin co-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (0.3%). Conclusions: In Latium, drugs are widely used in pregnancy. Prescriptions of inappropriate drugs are observed in more than a fifth of pregnancies, and teratogens are still used, despite their known risk Continuous updates of information provided to practitioners and an increased availability of information to women might reduce inappropriate prescribing."
432096400043,NANOSCALE,A rationally designed self-standing V2O5 electrode for high voltage non-aqueous all-solid-state symmetric (2.0 V) and asymmetric (2.8 V) supercapacitors,"The maximum capacitive potential window of certain pseudocapacitive materials cannot be accessed in aqueous electrolytes owing to the low dissociation potential of 1.2 V possessed by water molecules. However, the inferior pseudocapacitance exhibited by the commonly used electrode materials when integrated with non-aqueous electrolytes still remains a challenge in the development of supercapacitors (SC). Proper selection of materials for the electrode and a rational design process are indeed important to overcome these practical intricacies so that such systems can perform well with non-aqueous electrolytes. We address this challenge by fabricating a prototype all-solid-state device designed with high-capacitive V2O5 as the electrode material along with a Li-ion conducting organic electrolyte. V2O5 is synthesized on a pre-treated carbon-fibre paper by adopting an electrochemical deposition technique that effects an improved contact resistance. A judicious electrode preparation strategy makes it possible to overcome the constraints of the low ionic and electrical conductivities imposed by the electrolyte and electrode material, respectively. The device, assembled in a symmetrical fashion, achieves a high specific capacitance of 406 F g(-1) (at 1 A g(-1)). The profitable aspect of using an organic electrolyte is also demonstrated with an asymmetric configuration by using activated carbon as the positive and V2O5 as the negative electrode materials, respectively. The asymmetric device displays a wide working-voltage window of 2.8 V and delivers a high energy density of 102.68 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 1.49 kW kg(-1). Moreover, the low equivalent series resistance of 9.9 Omega and negligible charge transfer resistance are observed in the impedance spectra, which is a key factor that accounts for such an exemplary performance."
432612800010,HEALTH EDUCATION & BEHAVIOR,Association Between Subjective Obesity Status and Smoking Behavior Among Normal-Weight Women,"Smoking and obesity are chief causes of mortality, morbidity, and medical expenditure. However, few studies have investigated the linkage between subjective obesity status and smoking behavior. This study examines whether females in a normal body mass index range who perceive themselves as obese are more likely to smoke than those who do not perceive themselves as obese. Stratifying by age-group, I employed the propensity score matching analysis to control for selection bias. Although body mass index is lower for younger females aged 20 to 39, they are more likely than elder females to consider themselves as obese. Based on a logistic regression, my findings show that younger females who perceive themselves as obese are 21.2% more likely to smoke than females who do not perceive themselves as obese. The positive relationship between perceived obesity status and smoking behavior is also found in the propensity score matching analysis. However, the disparity in smoking prevalence is not detected between elder females who perceive themselves as obese and those who do not. Public education that fosters accurate perception of body shape is imperative in inducing healthy lifestyles and improving social welfare."
446102300004,JOURNAL OF ELASTOMERS AND PLASTICS,Poly(propylene)/waste vulcanized ethylene- propylene-diene monomer (PP/WEPDM) blends prepared by high-shear thermo-kinetic mixer,"Polypropylene (PP)-waste elastomer blends are particularly attractive as an economical way of producing sustainable materials, relieving the stress on the environment. Although PP is a commodity thermoplastic finding employment in various applications, its relatively low impact strength might be a significant factor limiting the variety of uses in many industries. Extensive consumption of thermoset elastomers has been a worldwide waste disposal problem. Here, we describe a facile, economical method for reuse of waste ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) rubber to produce impact resistant blend materials with the PP via a high-shear thermokinetic mixer. In these blends, waste EPDM was used in various concentrations ranging from 20 to 80 wt%, as the remaining part, PP acts as a carrier matrix or a physical binder depending on the concentration in the blend. Briefly, fivefold increase was achieved in the impact resistance of PP by the addition of 60 wt% EPDM waste. The blend with 80 wt% waste EPDM shows characteristics similar to a thermoplastic elastomer. The conclusion of the study is that the blending method is quite effective to produce high-performance blend materials consisting of high concentrations of thermoset waste which addresses the worldwide disposal problem of waste thermoset rubbers."
452815700008,GROWTH HORMONE & IGF RESEARCH,Standardizing protocols dealing with growth hormone receptor gene disruption in mice using the Cre-lox system,"Objective: Mice and humans with reduced growth hormone (GH) action before birth are conferred positive health- and life-span advantages. However, little work has been performed to study the effect of conditional disruption of GH action in adult life. With this as our objective, we sought to elucidate a reproducible protocol that allows generation of adult mice with a global disruption of the GH receptor (Ghr) gene, using the tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible Cre-lox system, driven by the ROSA26 enhancer/promoter. Here we report the optimum conditions for the gene disruption. Design: Six month old mice, homozygous for the ROSA26-Cre and the Ghr-floxed gene, were injected, once daily for five days with four distinct TAM doses (from 0.08 to 0.32 mg of TAM/g of body weight). To evaluate the most effective TAM dose that leads to global disruption of the GHR, mRNA expression of the Ghr and insulin growth factor-1 (Igf1) genes were assessed in liver, adipose tissue, kidney, and skeletal and cardiac muscles of experimental and control mice. Additionally, serum GH and IGF-1 levels were evaluated one month after TAM injections in both, TAM-treated and TAM-untreated control mice. Results: A dose of 0.25 mg of TAM/g of body weight was sufficient to significantly reduce the Ghr and Igf1 expression levels in the liver, fat, kidney, and skeletal and cardiac muscle of six-month old mice that are homozygous for the Ghr floxed gene and Cre recombinase. The reduction of the Ghr mRNA levels of the TAM treated mice was variable between tissues, with liver and adipose tissue showing the lowest and skeletal and cardiac muscle the highest levels of Ghr gene expression when compared to control mice. Moreover, liver tissue showed the 'best' Ghr gene disruption, resulting in decreased total circulating IGF-1 levels while GH levels were increased versus control mice. Conclusion: The results show that in mice at six months of age, a total TAM dose of at least 0.25 mg of TAM/g of body weight is needed for a global downregulation of Ghr gene expression with a regimen of 100 mu L intraperitoneal (ip) TAM injections, once daily for five consecutive days. Furthermore, we found that even though this system does not achieve an equivalent disruption of the Ghr between tissues, the circulating IGF-1 is > 95% decreased. This work helped to create adult mice with a global GHR knockdown."
427639400002,CALCOLO,An inexact Newton method for solving complementarity problems in hydrodynamic lubrication,"We present an iterative procedure based on a damped inexact Newton iteration for solving linear complementarity problems. We introduce the method in the framework of a popular problem arising in mechanical engineering: the analysis of cavitation in lubricated contacts. In this context, we show how the perturbation and the damping parameter are chosen in our method and we prove the global convergence of the entire procedure. A Fortran implementation of the method is finally analyzed. First, we validate the procedure and analyze all its components, performing also a comparison with a recently proposed technique based on the Fischer-Burmeister-Newton iteration. Then, we solve a 2D problem and provide some insights on an efficient implementation of the method exploiting routines of the Lapack and of the PETSc packages for the solution of inner linear systems."
435933100046,CHEMISTRYSELECT,Effects of Structural Modification on the Photoelectrical Properties of the D-A-pi-A-Type Dyes in DSSCs: A Computational Investigation,"The structure-activity relationships of the three D-A-pi-A type dyes (LC6, LC7 and LC8) were investigated via density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT methods. The results indicate the substitution of thiophene with benzene ring as spacer has intensified the distortion in the structure of LC8, which will ease the aggregation of dye on the photocathode. The greatest shift of the conduction band of TiO2, driving force of electron injection, excited state lifetime and lowest lateral intermolecular charge transfer rate of LC8 leads to the prominent photoelectrical properties among the three dyes. In addition, three novel dyes (LC81, LC82 and LC83) were designed via introducing a -CN group into the structure of LC8. The obtained results imply that the designed dye LC81 would exhibit the outstanding photoelectrical characteristics among LC8 and its derivatives, owing to its lowest energy gap, chemical hardness, and the greatest polarizability, total first hyperpolarizability, electrophilicity and electroaccepting power, which can provide a theory evidence for the experimental synthesis of dyes with better efficiency."
419091600001,ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY,ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphism is not associated with chemotherapy treatment outcomes in gastric cancer patients: evidence from 11 publications in Chinese populations,"Background: A number of studies have investigated the roles of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) gene rs3212986 polymorphisms as potential biomarkers in gastric cancer (GC). However, the results were inconsistent. Here, we performed a metaanalysis to explore ERCC1 rs3212986 polymorphisms in the chemotherapy response and clinical outcome of GC. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched up to July 28, 2017, for studies on the association between ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphisms and response to chemotherapy as well as overall survival time of GC. A fixed-effect or random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) based on the results from the heterogeneity tests. Results: The result revealed that there was no significant association between the ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphism and response to chemotherapy in GC under comparison models (AA + CA versus CC, OR 0.95, P= 0.80, AA versus CA, OR 0.85, P= 0.55, AA versus CC, OR 0.74, P= 0.47). Further identification suggested that ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphisms were not linked with the overall survival of GC (AA + CA versus CC, OR 1.09, P= 0.52, AA versus CA, OR 1.05, P= 0.85, AA versus CC, OR 1.43, P= 0.23). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis indicated that the ERCC1 rs3212986 A/C polymorphism was not associated with response to chemotherapy or overall survival time in GC. Well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and more ethnic groups should be performed to further validate our results."
440778600101,PLOS ONE,MALDI-TOF analysis of blood serum proteome can predict the presence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance,"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a plasma cell dyscrasia that can progress to malignant multiple myeloma (MM). Specific molecular biomarkers to classify the MGUS status and discriminate the initial asymptomatic phase of MM have not been identified. We examined the serum peptidome profile of MGUS patients and healthy volunteers using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and developed a predictive model for classifying serum samples. The predictive model was built using a support vector machine (SVM) supervised learning method tuned by applying a 20-fold cross-validation scheme. Predicting class labels in a blinded test set containing randomly selected MGUS and healthy control serum samples validated the model. The generalization performance of the predictive model was evaluated by a double cross-validation method that showed 88% average model accuracy, 89% average sensitivity and 86% average specificity. Our model, which classifies unknown serum samples as belonging to either MGUS patients or healthy individuals, can be applied to clinical diagnosis."
455083600011,NUTRICION HOSPITALARIA,"Frailty in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its relation with glucemic control, lipid profile, blood pressure, balance, disability grade and nutritional status","Introduction: frailty identifies a subgroup of people with higher risk of morbidity and mortality. Aims: our first aim was to determine the prevalence of frailty in older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus; our second aim was to establish which factors are associated with frailty in these patients. Material and methods: cross-sectional study in non-institutionalized people (288 patients), over 65 years of age, and diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2. Frailty was defined according to Freid's criteria. The following variables were assessed: blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, Lawton and Brody index, balance through unipodal support, and nutritional status by using the Mini Nutritional Assessment questionnaire. Results: the prevalence of frailty syndrome was 14.6%. The frailty group showed lower systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), higher triglycerides levels (p = 0.007), and lower Lawton and Brody values (p < 0.001) than the non-frailty one; moreover, lower monopodal balance was observed with higher frailty levels (r = -0.306, p < 0.001). None frailty-subject was able to perform five seconds or more in balance (r = -0.343, p < 0.001). Moreover, higher frailty was related with poorer Mini Nutritional Assessment results (p = 0.013). Conclusion: the prevalence of frailty syndrome in patients with diabetes was higher compared with those in general population over 65 years of age. Frailty was related to lower systolic blood pressure, higher triglycerides concentrations, poorer nutritional status, and lower independency to perform instrumental activities of daily living and poorer balance."
444724300005,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Implementing Majorana fermions in a cold-atom honeycomb lattice with textured pairings,"Recent studies in the realization of Majorana fermion (MF) quasiparticles have focused on engineering topological superconductivity that derives from proximity effects of conventional superconductors and spin textures. We propose an effective model to create unpaired MFs at a honeycomb lattice edge by generalizing a two-dimensional topologically nontrivial Haldane model and introducing textured pairings. The core idea is to add both the spin-singlet and textured spin-triplet pairings to a pseudospin-state-dependent, time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) noninvariant honeycomb lattice, and to satisfy generalized ""sweet spot"" conditions as in the Kitaev chain model. Our model has a gapped superconducting phase and a gapless phase; either phase may have zero or nonzero topological winding numbers. The discriminant that distinguishes those two phases gives a measure of TRS breaking and may have more general implications. Effective Majorana zero modes arise at edges in distinct phases with different degrees of degeneracy. Our theoretical model motivates concepts, such as ""textured pairings"" and the ""strength"" of TRS breaking, that may play important roles in future implementation of MFs with cold atoms in optical lattices."
432766000013,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY,Passive sentence comprehension difficulties and its related factors in children with cochlear implants,"Objectives: The purposes of this study were to investigate which syntactic structures, from active and passive sentences, sensitively differentiate children with cochlear implants (CIs) from children with normal hearing, (NH), to explore the correlations among working memory (WM) and other factors for each group, and to examine predictors of the active and passive sentence scores for both groups. Methods: Twenty deaf children with CIs and 20 children with NH, aged 8-14 years, were included in this study. Sentence comprehension skills were measured using the picture-pointing comprehension task, which consisted of active and passive sentences. The WM capacity was tested by the digit forward, digit backward, word forward, and word backward span tasks. Results: Passive sentence type was a significant predictor to differentiate between the two groups (p < .05). In the CI group, passive sentence scores were significantly correlated with age, duration of an implant use, receptive vocabulary scores, and WM scores (all p values < .05). In the stepwise regression analysis, WM capacity, was a significant factor in predicting the passive sentence scores of children with CIs (p < .05). Conclusion: Passive sentence type was a significant factor in distinguishing the CI group from the NH group. The WM capacity was an important predictor accounting for individual differences in processing complex sentence types for children with CIs. The results indicate that a complex syntactic form may serve as a clinically critical index in detecting higher-level cognitive and linguistic processing difficulties in good performers after implantation."

430767400009,JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS,"Functionalization of polypropylene, polyamide and cellulose acetate materials with pyrethrum extract as a natural repellent in supercritical carbon dioxide","This study discusses the possibility of supercritical solvent impregnation of polypropylene and polyamide fabrics as well as cellulose acetate in the form of beads and films with pyrethrum extract in order to fabricate functionalized materials with repellent properties. Impregnation experiments were performed at temperature of 40 degrees C and pressures of 10 and 20 MPa in supercritical carbon dioxide. The time of impregnation was varied from 0.5 to 18 h. Loadings of pyrethrum extract into polypropylene fabrics and cellulose acetate films higher than 30% were attainable at 10 MPa. In the case of polyamide fabrics and cellulose acetate beads, the pressure of 20 MPa was needed for obtaining the loadings higher than 11%. Pyrethrum extract release study revealed different capabilities of the tested materials for the repellent release, implying a variety of their possible applications. The impregnated solids were characterized by SEM, DSC, FTIR, Mercury intrusion porosimetry analyses and HPLC analyses."
433555900001,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,Dysbiosis and Ecotypes of the Salivary Microbiome Associated With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and the Assistance in Diagnosis of Diseases Using Oral Bacterial Profiles,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic, idiopathic, relapsing disorders of unclear etiology affecting millions of people worldwide. Aberrant interactions between the human microbiota and immune system in genetically susceptible populations underlie IBD pathogenesis. Despite extensive studies examining the involvement of the gut microbiota in IBD using culture-independent techniques, information is lacking regarding other human microbiome components relevant to IBD. Since accumulated knowledge has underscored the role of the oral microbiota in various systemic diseases, we hypothesized that dissonant oral microbial structure, composition, and function, and different community ecotypes are associated with IBD; and we explored potentially available oral indicators for predicting diseases. We examined the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of salivary bacterial DNA from 54 ulcerative colitis (UC), 13 Crohn's disease (CD), and 25 healthy individuals using Illumina sequencing. Distinctive sample clusters were driven by disease or health based on principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of both the Operational Taxonomic Unit profile and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Comparisons of taxa abundances revealed enrichment of Streptococcaceae (Streptococcus) and Enterobacteriaceae in UC and Veillonellaceae (Veillonella) in CD, accompanied by depletion of Lachnospiraceae and [Prevotella] in UC and Neisseriaceae (Neisseria) and Haemophilus in CD, most of which have been demonstrated to exhibit the same variation tendencies in the gut of IBD patients. IBD-related oral microorganisms were associated with white blood cells, reduced basic metabolic processes, and increased biosynthesis and transport of substances facilitating oxidative stress and virulence. Furthermore, UC and CD communities showed robust sub-ecotypes that were not demographic or severity-specific, suggesting their value for future applications in precision medicine. Additionally, indicator species analysis revealed several genera indicative of UC and CD, which were confirmed in a longitudinal cohort. Collectively, this study demonstrates evident salivary dysbiosis and different ecotypes in IBD communities and provides an option for identifying at-risk populations, not only enhancing our understanding of the IBD microbiome apart from the gut but also offering a clinically useful strategy to track IBD as saliva can be sampled conveniently and non-invasively."
451954700051,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Transient dispersion of an initial point pollutant concentration in wetland flows,"Initial point pollutant transport in wetland flows acts as a typical form in various applications. Accurate determination of the basic characteristics for dispersion fundamentally supports the predication of pollutant transport especially in the transient stage. This work analytically studies the transient dispersion of an initial point pollutant concentration in wetland flows through the phase average technique and the method of concentration moments. The characteristics including the vertical mass distribution, longitudinal displacement, dispersivity, skewness, and kurtosis corresponding to the zeroth- to fourth-order concentration moments are accurately illustrated in their full-time dependance for the first time. Present results show to be distinctive from those of initial uniform concentration in the transient dispersion process. The temporal evolutions of the five characteristics are all dependent of the initial point release position. The results further demonstrate that the timescale 3.0 as measured by the skewness, rather than 0.5 as measured by the dispersivity, should be characterized as the transient period for the dispersion of initial point concentration in comparison with that of initial uniform. Furthermore, the longitudinally distributed mean concentration is as well analyzed through the Hermite polynomials. The results imply that strict criteria for environmental and ecological implications should be established by further accounting for the five characteristics."

The objectives of this study were to assess the adherence to the MD among pregnant women in Valencia (Spain) and characterize the pregnant women according to their level of adherence. Finally, we aimed to examine the role of MD adherence during pregnancy in the anthropometric development of the newborn. The study included 492 pregnant women who were followed at La Fe Hospital in 2017. The self-administered ""Kidmed"" questionnaire for data collection on dietary information evaluation was used and a clinical history review of mothers and newborns was performed. Two groups of mothers were identified: those with low adherence (LA) and optimal adherence (OA). The study revealed that 40.2% of the women showed LA to the MD. The newborns born to these women presented a higher risk of being small for gestational age (SGA) {adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-5.46} when adjusting for parental body mass index (BMI) and multiple gestation, but not when adjusting for all significant possible confounders (aOR = 2.32; 95% CI 0.69-7.78). The association between MD and SGA was not significantly affected by the use of iron and folic acid supplements (aOR = 2.65; 95% CI 0.66-10.65). The profile of the pregnant woman with LA is that of a young smoker, with a low level of education and a low daily intake of dairy products. These results suggest that LA to the MD is not associated with a higher risk of giving birth to a SGA newborn."

The mixed aerogel of CNC and CNF showed better performance than that from pure CNC or CNF. What's more, the mixture ratio of CNC and CNF has great influences on the properties of the prepared aerogel. When the mixture ratio of CNF and CNC was 3:1, the internal of aerogel presents a uniform three-dimensional network structure with abundant pores. It exhibited a higher specific surface area of up to 143 m(2)/g and the compressive strength was 0.202 MPa under 80% strain. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
428974000008,TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,QUO VADIS? MAJOR PLAYERS IN GLOBAL COAL CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS REDUCTION,"The expansion of fossil fuel consumption, particularly that of coal, drives global socio-economic development and causes large-scale emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). The key to the reduction of global CO2 emissions lies in whether major CO2 emitters can meet established reduction goals. This paper reviews the histories of China, the United States, and India in terms of their respective CO2 emission pathways, reflects on the motivations and mechanisms behind these changes, and predicts whether these three major CO2 emitters can control their coal consumption and promote reduction of global CO2 emissions. We conclude that China is decreasing its coal consumption, India is experiencing irreversible, increase of coal consumption, and the use of coal in the U.S. will depend largely on the energy and climate policies of the Trump administration. To achieve the goal of reduction of global CO2 emissions, the international community should not only increase its scrutiny of coal consumption and CO2 emissions in India but also emphasise the role of international cooperation, which is the only solution to tackling the reduction of CO2 emissions and limiting anthropogenic climate change as economic systems continue to globalise."
428520500004,OPHTHALMIC GENETICS,Prevalence of macular abnormalities assessed by optical coherence tomography in patients with Usher syndrome,"Background: To investigate the prevalence of macular abnormalities in patients affected by Usher syndrome (USH), by comparing the clinical findings between two types (i.e., USH1 and USH2). Material and methods: A retrospective study was performed by reviewing optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 134 USH patients to determine the presence of macular abnormalities, including cystoid macular edema (CME), epiretinal membrane (ERM), vitreo-macular traction syndrome (VMT), and macular hole (MH). Results: Macular abnormalities were observed in 126/268 (47.0%) examined eyes. The most frequent abnormality was ERM observed in 51 eyes (19%), followed by CME observed in 42 eyes (15.7%). Moreover, CME was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with younger age (CME: 30.1 +/- 11.1 years; without CME: 36.9 +/- 14.9 years), whereas VMT and full thickness MH were associated with older age (p < 0.05). Moreover, a significantly (p < 0.05) decreased best-corrected visual acuity was associated with MH compared to eyes without MH. Finally, CME was more frequent in USH1 compared to USH2. Conclusion: Our study, for the first time in the literature, showed the distribution of all macular abnormalities assessed by SD-OCT in a large USH cohort, comparing USH1 and USH2 patients. We observed that ocular abnormalities are highly prevalent in USH patients compared to general population, with ERM and CME being the most common alterations. Based on these findings, OCT screening in USH patients is recommended for early detection of macular changes and early treatment."
441993000007,BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION,What is wrong with energy efficiency?,"At first sight the purpose of energy efficiency is plain: it is to reduce the amount of energy used and the carbon emissions associated with the design and operation of things like buildings, domestic appliances, and heating and cooling technologies, or with the organization of bureaucratic, business or industrial processes. National and international responses to climate change are dominated by policies that promote energy efficiency and by people who take this to be a self-evidently important thing to do. Established criticisms, including those which focus on problems of rebound, draw attention to the unintended consequences of such strategies, but rarely challenge the conceptual foundations of efficiency' as a topic in its own right. This paper uses Bruno Latour's We Have Never Been Modern (1993) notion of purification and Ian Hodder's Entangled: An Archaeology of the Relationships Between Humans and Things (2012) ideas about entanglement to develop a more fundamental critique and to argue that, far from being a solution, efficiency, as currently constituted, undermines that which it is expected to achieve. It is concluded that if carbon emissions are to be reduced on any significant scale, then it is essential to consider the meanings and levels of service and the types of consumption and demand that efficiency policies support and perpetuate."
424295200004,JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES,Community forest concessionaires: resisting green grabs and producing political subjects in Guatemala,"In 2005, Guatemalan community forest concessionaires achieved a remarkable legislative victory that reversed a green land grab in the Maya Biosphere. The fight over this space, the Mirador Basin, provides valuable contributions to analyses of global land grabs, grassroots politics and power relations underpinning environmental governance. First, the fight for the Mirador Basin illustrates how green land grabs create new natures, rather than simply enclosing existing green spaces. Second, it contributes to recent scholarship detailing land-grabbing practices of resistance, acquiescence and incorporation from below' by describing how Maya Biosphere community forest concessionaires were able to reverse a green grab. Lastly, I argue this successful reversal largely rests on the articulation and mobilization of a new rights-bearing subject - the forest concessionaire. Struggles for land in the Maya Biosphere illustrate that practices and relations of green governance do not always create disciplined, neo-liberal, green subjects. Rather, community forestry has provided a political platform turning reserve residents into influential actors participating in the re-territorialization of power in contemporary Guatemala."
432528000005,FASEB JOURNAL,Prostaglandin I-2 suppresses the development of diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Although the prostaglandin (PG)I2 receptor IP is expressed broadly in the liver, the role of PGI2-IP signaling in the development of NASH remains to be determined. Here, we investigated the role of the PGI2-IP system in the development of steatohepatitis using mice lacking the PGI2 receptor IP [IP-knockout (IP-KO) mice] and beraprost (BPS), a specific IP agonist. IP-KO and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a methionine-and choline-deficient diet (MCDD) for 2, 5, or 10 wk. BPS was administered orally to mice every day during the experimental periods. The effect of BPS on the expression of chemokine and inflammatory cytokines was examined also in cultured Kupffer cells. WT mice fed MCDD developed steatohepatitis at 10 wk. IP-KO mice developed steatohepatitis at 5 wk with augmented histologic derangements accompanied by increased hepatic monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and TNF-a concentrations. After 10 wk of MCDD, IP-KO mice had greater hepatic iron deposition with prominent oxidative stress, resulting in hepatocyte damage. In WT mice, BPS improved histologic and biochemical parameters of steatohe-patitis, accompanied by reduced hepatic concentration of MCP-1 and TNF-alpha. Accordingly, BPS suppressed the LPS-stimulated Mcp-1 and Tnf-a mRNA expression in cultured Kupffer cells prepared from WT mice. PGI2-IP signaling plays a crucial role in the development and progression of steatohepatitis by modulating the inflammatory response, leading to augmented oxidative stress. We suggest that the PGI2-IP system is an attractive therapeutic target for treating patients with NASH."
428951000009,BIOMEDICAL PAPERS-OLOMOUC,Comparison of lymphatic vessel density and expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D lymphangiogenic factors in Warthin's tumours and oncocytic adenomas,"Objectives. To compare the density of lymphatic vessels and VEGF-C and VEGF-D expression in Warthin's tumours (WTs) and oncocytic adenomas (OCAs). Methods. Twenty three WTs and 13 OCAs of the parotid gland were analyzed. Lymphatic vessels were detected using the D2-40 antibody. For evaluation of the intratumour and peritumour lymphatic vessel density (iLVD and pLVD, respectively) the area of greatest vascularisation (hot spots) was chosen, using a x40 field, and the number of vessels per square millimeter was counted in a x200 field. The staining intensity for VEGF-C and VEGF-D immunoreaction in the tumour cells was graded from 0 to 3. Results. The mean iLVD and pLVD values in WTs was 4.7 (range 1-8) and 6.9 (range 3-10), those in the OCAs 1.0 (range 0-3) and 5.8 (range 2-8), respectively. The differences in the iLVD, but not pLVD between the two tumour groups were statistically significant. In both entities, the pLVD markedly outnumbered the iLVD. The intratumour vessels in the WTs were present exclusively in the lymphoid stroma. In the group of 23 WTs, 13 (56.6%), 17 (73.9%) and 10 (43.4%) samples revealed positive VEGF-C, VEGF-D and both immunoreactions, respectively. 10 of 13 (77%) cases revealed VEGF-D immunoreaction and in none of them was the VEGF-C reaction present. Conclusion. The tumours had a comparable high density of peritumorous lymphatic network. However, WTs markedly differed from OCAs in the number of the intratumorous vessels. These were abundant solely in the stroma of WT, while practically lacking in the neoplastic epithelium of the WT and relatively rare in OCAs. We suggest that homeostasis in both entities is mediated mainly by peritumorous lymphatics. The lymphatic drainage in WTs is also fostered exclusively by stromal lymphatics, whereas in stroma poor OCAs by the vessels present in their neoplastic epithelium. We also believe that WTs stimulate proliferation of pre-existing lymphatic capillaries by means of the paracrine secretion of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in the neoplastic as well as reactive stromal cells, while in the OCAs only the latter factor takes part in their lymphangiogenesis."

The identification criteria were studied following SANTE guidelines (retention time, mass accuracy, and ion ratio), comfortably complying with the values established, even at 0.003 mg/kg. Method validation was carried out on 15 selected GC amenable pesticides covered by Commission Directive No. 2006/125/EC in three different baby food matrixes. Recovery studies were performed at 0.003 and 0.006 mg/kg, with 96% of the cases falling within-the 70-120% range and with RSDs <15% for all the pesticides assayed. Linearity over 3 orders of magnitude was verified, with residuals <16% and correlation coefficient values >0.995. In general, matrix effect values were >100%. The LOQ was 0.003 mg/kg for 97% of the cases. The validated method was applied to 20 real baby food samples from Spain and to the European Union Proficiency Test FV-BF01 sample, in which the z-scores obtained were <1, thus demonstrating that this instrumentation has good quantitation capabilities."
432146300015,NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH,Exposure to Far Infrared Ray Protects Methamphetamine-Induced Behavioral Sensitization in Glutathione Peroxidase-1 Knockout Mice via Attenuating Mitochondrial Burdens and Dopamine D1 Receptor Activation,"Evidence indicates that stress conditions might lead to drug dependence. Recently, we have demonstrated that exposure to far infrared ray (FIR) attenuates acute restraint stress via induction of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) gene. We investigated whether FIR affects methamphetamine (MA)-induced behavioral sensitization and whether FIR-mediated pharmacological activity requires interaction between dopamine receptor and GPx-1 gene. We observed that MA treatment significantly increased GPx-1 expression in the striatum of wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, exposure to FIR potentiated MA-induced increase in GPx-1 expression. This phenomenon was also observed in animals receiving MA with dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390. However, dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride did not affect MA-induced GPx-1 expression. FIR exposure or SCH23390, but not sulpiride, significantly attenuated MA-induced behavioral sensitization. Exposure to FIR significantly attenuated MA-induced dopamine D1 receptor expression, c-Fos induction and oxidative burdens. FIR-mediated antioxidant effects were also more pronounced in mitochondrial- than cytosolic-fraction. In addition, FIR significantly attenuated against MA-induced changes in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and mitochondrial GPx activities, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, intramitochondrial Ca2+ level, mitochondrial complex-I activity, and mitochondrial oxidative burdens. The attenuation by FIR was paralleled that by SCH23390. Effects of FIR or SCH23390 were more sensitive to GPx-1 KO than WT mice, while SCH23390 treatment did not exhibit any additive effects on the protective activity mediated by FIR, indicating that dopamine D1 receptor constitutes a molecular target of FIR. Our result suggests that exposure to FIR ameliorates MA-induced behavioral sensitization via possible interaction between dopamine D1 receptor and GPx-1 gene."

Patients refractory to standard antimuscarinic therapy often experience recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs). The microbiota of these refractory patients with rUTI remains unexplored. A midstream urine (MSU) sample was collected from patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI during acute symptomatic episodes. Culture-based diagnosis was performed using routine microbiological methods. Culture-independent profiling was performed using bacterial 16S RNA profiling. E. coli strain typing was performed by amplicon pyrosequencing of the fimH gene. Over 2 years, 39 patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI were studied, yielding 9 severely affected cases. These 9 patients were carefully monitored for a further 2 years, resulting in the collection of 102 MSU samples, 70 of which were diagnosed as UTI (median of 8 UTIs/woman). Culture-independent analysis of 38 of these samples revealed the existence of a diverse urinary microbiota. Strain typing of E. coli identified instances of rUTI caused by the same persisting strain and by new infecting strains. Patients with refractory urge incontinence and coexistent rUTI possess a diverse urinary microbiota, suggesting that persistent bladder colonisation might augment the pathology of their chronic condition."

Methods: A multiyear (2003 to 2013) cross-sectional analysis of employer-sponsored health care claims for enrolled workers (N: 21,357 to 44,769) was erformed. Results: The proportion of workers prescribed opioids nearly doubled in the 10-year period. The strongest predictor of chronic opioid prescribing was year, with an increase in prescriptions each year from 2003 to 2013 (odds ratio = 2.90, 95% confidence interval: 2.41 to 3.48). Additional predictors included older age, white race, hourly wage, low back pain, and osteoarthritis. Conclusions: Opioid prescribing for industrial workers substantially increased from 2003 to 2013. Occupational health professionals should be aware of the potential for chronic opioid use among workers to assess job safety and appropriate treatment of work-related injuries."

However, the detailed nature and nolosogic validity of the comorbidity have not been fully explored. This study investigated the comorbidity rate, clinical nature, and correlates of OCD in patients with BD. Methods: Patients (n = 314) with BD were recruited and lifetime clinical characteristics were evaluated comprehensively. The comorbid OCD ('OCD-BD') group and the 'non-OC BD' group were compared in terms of the clinical variables of BD. Results: OCD was found in 15.9% of patients. Earlier age at onset, more frequent pharmacological (hypo) manic switch and a higher rate of comorbid panic disorder were associated with comorbid OCD. In two-thirds (65.4%) of the OCD-BD subjects, obsessive-compulsive symptoms worsened or were confined to depressive episodes. Contamination obsession and checking compulsion were the most common types of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Drug-induced (hypo) manic switch was observed in more than 60% of the OCD-BD subjects who were previously exposed to antidepressants. None of the OCD-BD subjects were taking antidepressants for OCD in the current specialty clinics. Limitations: Subject recruitment from specialty clinics, retrospective and cross-sectional evaluation, and difficulties in clarifying the causal relationships. Conclusions: The comorbidity rate of OCD in Korean BD patients was comparable to that of Caucasian patients. Even though OCD seems to be more often linked to depressive episodes, a heterogeneous nosologic relationship including a possibility of drug-mediated induction is suggested."
441430100053,CANCER MEDICINE,Value of incorporating newly identified risk factors into risk prediction for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia,"Several comorbidities have recently been shown to affect risk of chemotherapyinduced febrile neutropenia (FN). Here, we evaluated the added predictive value of these comorbidities beyond established FN risk factors. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among adult patients diagnosed with cancer and treated with chemotherapy at Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2000 and 2009. The study cohort was equally split into training and validation datasets to develop and evaluate the performance of FN risk prediction models in the first chemotherapy cycle. A reference model was developed based on the model proposed by Lyman et al (Cancer 2011;117:1917). A new model was developed by incorporating the newly identified comorbidities such as rheumatoid conditions and thyroid disorders into the reference model. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC), risk reclassification, and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to evaluate the potential improvement of FN risk prediction by incorporating comorbidities. A total of 15 279 patients were included; 4.2% experienced FN in the first chemotherapy cycle. Including comorbidities in FN risk prediction did not improve AUROCC (reference model 0.71 vs new model 0.72). A significant improvement, in individual-level FN risk prediction was indicated by IDI (P = .02). However, significant improvement in risk reclassification was not observed overall (although 6% of all patients were more accurately classified for their FN risk level, 5% were less accurately classified) or when examining predicted FN risk among patients who did and did not develop FN. Incorporating several new comorbidities into FN prediction led to improved FN risk prediction in the first chemotherapy cycle, although the observed improvements were small and might not be clinically relevant."

Various nanoemulsionns of EEO were prepared using aqueous phase titration method and the zones of nanoemulsion were identified by the construction of phase diagrams. EEO nanoemulsions were investigated in terms of physical stability, self-nanoemulsification efficiency and physicochemical characterization. Optimized nanoemulsion of EEO was selected for wound healing study, collagen estimation and histopathological evaluation in rats in comparison with pure EEO and standard gentamycin. Optimized nanoemulsion presented significant would healing activity in rats as compared with pure EEO upon oral administration. The wound healing activity of optimized nanoemulsion was comparable with standard gentamycin. Optimized EEO nanoemulsion also presented significant enhancement in collagen content as compared with pure EEO and negative control. However, the collagen contents of optimized nanoemulsion treated animals were comparable with standard gentamycin-treated animals. Histopathological studies of optimized nanoemulsion treated rats showed no signs of inflammatory cells which suggested the safety and non-toxicity of EEO nanoemulsion. This study suggested the potential of nanoemulsion in enhancing the wound healing activity of EEO upon oral administration."

However, a number of barriers have been identified as limiting the implementation of the approach, including workplace culture and a lack of accessible and effective sensory approaches training. The aim of this project was to investigate the efficacy of providing this training through a custom-designed e-learning package. Participants in the present study were predominately nurses and occupational therapists working in mental health settings in Queensland, Australia. Data were collected from 121 participants using an online survey. Significant improvements were found between pre- and post-training in participants' real and perceived levels of knowledge, their perceived levels of confidence, and their attitudes towards using sensory modulation approaches in mental health settings. The findings of the study suggest that the custom-designed sensory approaches e-learning package is an effective, accessible, acceptable, and usable method to train health professionals in sensory modulation approaches. As this study is the first to analyse the efficacy of an e-learning sensory approaches package, the results are considered preliminary, and further investigation is required."
450634500009,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE,Cervical cancer screening among immigrant women in Norway- The healthcare providers' perspectives,"Objective: To explore health care providers' (HCPs) experiences regarding cervical cancer screening (CCS) among immigrant women, their strategies to facilitate these consultations and their need for further information. Design: Exploratory qualitative design. Setting: HCPs who perform CCS: general practitioners, midwives and private gynaecologists, working in Oslo, Norway. Subjects: We interviewed 26 general practitioners, 3 midwives and 3 gynaecologists. Method: Both focus groups and personal in depth semi structured interviews. Interview transcripts were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: Some of the HCPs' experiences related to CCS were common for all women regardless of their immigrant background, such as the understanding of routines and responsibilities for prevention. Aspects specific for immigrant women were mainly related to organization, language, health literacy levels, culture and gender. Several strategies targeting organizational (longer consultations), language (using interpreters), health literacy (using anatomy models to explain) and culture (dealing with the expression of pain) were reported. Most HCPs had not previously reflected upon specific challenges linked to CCS among immigrant women, thus the interviews were an eye-opener to some extent. Ha's acknowledged that they need more knowledge on immigrant women's' reproductive health. Conclusion: HCPs' biases, stereotypes and assumptions could be a key provider-level barrier to low uptake of CCS test among immigrants if they remained unexplored and unchallenged. HCPs need more information on reproductive health of immigrant women in addition to cultural awareness."
429655000005,NERVENARZT,Clinical and cognitive aspects of functional (psychogenic) tremor,"Functional (psychogenic) tremor is the most common functional movement disorder. Characteristic clinical features, so called red flags, can help to make the clinical distinction of this type from other tremor disorders. The most common features include the variability of frequency and amplitude. Clinical examination should include different types of distraction including motor or cognitive tasks or testing the influence of suggestibility on tremor amplitude, frequency or direction. Patients often report sudden onset and remissions that may last for months or even years. In some cases, the tremor is only present in highly specific situations. Although functional tremor shares characteristics with voluntary actions, patients experience their abnormal movements as involuntary. Recent experimental approaches have revealed an impairment in sense of agency. The diagnosis can be supported by neurophysiological measurements including accelerometry, which achieved a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 95.9% in a validated test battery, thus providing a useful additional diagnostic tool. Psychotherapeutic treatment is indicated in patients with and without evident psychological symptoms. A specific physiotherapeutic approach for functional tremor is re-trainment."
423816600002,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,Organisational barriers to the facilitation of overseas volunteering and training placements in the NHS,"Background: Undertaking a period of voluntary work or a professional placement overseas has long been a feature of medical training in the UK. There are now a number of high profile National Health Service (NHS) initiatives aimed at increasing access to such opportunities for staff at all levels. We present findings from a qualitative study involving a range of NHS staff and other stakeholders which explored barriers to participation in these activities. Methods: A grounded theory methodology was drawn upon to conduct thematic based analysis. Our data included in-depth, semi-structured interviews with a range of returned volunteers, non-volunteers and other stakeholders (n = 51) who were, or had been, employed by the NHS. Results: There are significant barriers to placement and volunteering activity stemming from structural and organisational shortcomings within the NHS. Difficulties in filling clinical roles has a significant impact on the ability of staff to plan and undertake independent placements. There is currently no clearly defined pathway within the NHS by which the majority of grades can apply for, or organise, a period of overseas voluntary or professional placement activity. There were divergent views on the relevance and usefulness of overseas professional placements. Conclusions: We argue that in the context of current UK policy initiatives aimed at facilitating overseas volunteer and professional placement activity, urgent attention needs to be given to the structural and organisational framework within which such initiatives will be required to work."
451814700001,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,Caudal Fossa Ratio in Norma Dogs and Eurasier Dogs with VLDLR-Associated Genetic Cerebellar Hypoplasia,"Cerebellar and hindbrain malformations, such as cerebellar hypoplasia (CH), vermis hypoplasia, and Dandy-Walker malformation, occur in dogs as well as in humans. Neuroimaging is essential for a precise description of these malformations and defining translational animal models. Neuroimaging is increasingly performed in puppies, but there is a lack of data on developmental changes in the caudal fossa, which can impair assessment of caudal fossa size in this age group. The purpose of this study was to validate caudal fossa ratio (CFR) in dogs and to explore CFR in Eurasier dogs with genetic CH. CFR was calculated from midsagittal brain images of 130 dogs as caudal fossa area/total cranial cavity area. In addition, the volume of the caudal fossa was measured in 64 randomly selected dogs from this group. Repeated measurements were used to investigate inter- and intra-rater variability and influence of imaging modality. Furthermore, the influence of age, weight, and breed was explored. The CFR was a reliable parameter with negligible influence from the examiners, imaging modality, and weight of the dog. The midsagittal area of the caudal fossa and the volume of the caudal fossa correlated closely with each other. In this study, we observed a smaller CFR in puppies. The CFR in adult dogs lies within 0.255 and 0.330, while CFR is smaller in puppies up to 4 months of age. Besides age, there was also an effect of breed, which should be explored in larger data sets. Measurements of CFR in Eurasier dogs with genetic CH caused by a mutation in the very-low-density-lipoprotein-receptor gene revealed the presence of two variants, one with an enlarged caudal fossa and one with a normal to small caudal fossa. This observation indicates that there is phenotypic heterogeneity and interaction between the developing cerebellum and the surrounding mesenchyme in this animal model."
453579300019,SAINS MALAYSIANA,Discriminative and Predictive Ability of Physical Performance Measures in Identifying Fall Risk among Older Adults,"Falls are a public health concern among older adults. There is a need to take significant measures such as screening for the risk of a fall as a means of prevention and management. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine discriminative and predictive ability of physical performance measures in identifying the risk of fall among Malaysian community dwelling older adults. Three hundred twenty-five Malaysian community dwelling older adults aged 60 years and above (67.67 +/- 5.5 years) participated in this study. This study was a part of a larger longitudinal study 'ERGS TUA' . Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA), a comprehensive tool for quantifying risk of fall was used as a standard measure of comparison to 6 Meter Gait Speed (Gs), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Walking While Talking (WWT) tests to establish discriminative and predictive ability. Participants recorded incidence of falls in a 'falls diary' over a span of six months. To determine the optimum cut off scores of the test identified to classify fall risk, receiver operator curves (ROC) were used and its sensitivity and specificity were calculated. A significant mean difference between fallers and non-fallers was demonstrated only with TUG test (p<0.05). TUG test cut off score in discriminating older adults at risk of fall was established at eight seconds, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83.95% and 32.4%, respectively, in this study. Eighty-four percent older adults who experienced a fall in our study were identified to be at risk of fall when screened using this TUG cut off score. Our study results suggested TUG test to be an optimal screening tool for risk of fall among community dwelling older adults."
436905100011,METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE,Characterization of Thermal Stability and High-Temperature Tribological Behavior of Electroless Ni-B Coating,"A preliminary study has been conducted using sequences of isothermal heat treatments and unidirectional high-temperature wear test following ball-on-flat geometry against an alumina counterface, to assess thermal stability and high-temperature tribological properties of the crystalline electroless Ni-B coating, a potential candidate for high-temperature solid lubricant coating. Isothermal heat treatment of 450 A degrees C/15 h causes a significant amount of B diffusion into the Fe substrate without altering the coating's through-thickness hardness and nanostructure. At room temperature, a very low wear rate is observed, which increases up to two orders of magnitude above a testing temperature of 100 A degrees C. Room-temperature wear behavior is mostly governed by oxidative wear, where friction-induced heating produces a thick oxide scale on the wear track, which subsequently decreases the wear rate by preventing direct contact between the coating and counterface. In the case of wear tests above 100 A degrees C, removal of the same oxide layer occurs through local plastic deformation, essentially plastic ratcheting at the contacting region by flow softening of the contacting surface layer due to a local rise in temperature. Worn track morphology shows similarity with the severe wear seen in steel-steel contacts. Experimental observations have been explained and validated using the concept of contact point flash temperature. A quantitative assessment of contact point flash temperature has been carried out adopting the methodology, proposed by Ashby et al. The effects of applied normal load, test geometry, choice of counterface material, and testing temperatures on the transition of wear mechanism are critically discussed."
428130800010,SURFACE ENGINEERING,Ti and nitride surface modification of copper by pack cementation,"Copper is widely applied however its disadvantages such as low hardness and poor oxidation resistance. TiN coatings are often used industrially for overriding such disadvantages of ferrous components. In this examination the deposition of TiN on Cu substrates is investigated for the first time by pack cementation process with which one or more elements can be deposited simultaneously by gas and solid-state diffusion reactions. This feature makes this process very attractive for industrial use as it is economic and time saving. Microstructural examination of the deposited samples revealed the formation of thick coatings corresponding to Ti-Cu phases. Focusing on the coating surface it was found that a TiN thin layer is formed. This was verified also from hardness measurements which showed that there was a significant increase of the surface hardness. Furthermore, the oxidation resistance of the coated samples has considerably increased as implied from the thermogravimetric measurements."
445927500015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY,Hsa_circ_0102533 serves as a blood-based biomarker for non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosis and regulates apoptosis in vitro,"Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) as a new class of non-coding RNAs that are associated with cancer progression and can serve as potential markers for cancer diagnosis. However, the functions of circRNAs have not been completely clarified in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our study aimed to explore the expression profiles and apoptotic role of circRNAs in NSCLC. Methods: Forty-one NSCLC patients and twenty-six healthy subjects were recruited to our study. The levels of hsa_circ_0102533 in tumor tissues and whole blood were identified by circRNA microarray and RT-qPCR. The CCK-8 and apoptosis assays were performed in NSCLC cell lines after they were transfected with si-circRNA and si-NC. Results: Compared with the control group, hsa_circ_0102533 expression was significantly increased in tumor tissues and whole blood from NSCLC patients. ROC analysis showed that hsa_circ_0102533 had a higher diagnostic power for the detection of cancer in stage I-II NSCLC patients [AUC: 0.774 (95% CI: 0.624-0.923)] than in stage III-IV NSCLC patients [0.728 (95% CI: 0.588-0.869)]. Furthermore, the knockout of hsa_circ_0102533 by siRNA significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines. Conclusion: Hsa_circ_0102533 possesses an oncogenic property in the carcinogenesis of NSCLC and might be an early diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC detection."
439347300008,DIABETES,Membrane-Initiated Estrogen Receptor Signaling Mediates Metabolic Homeostasis via Central Activation of Protein Phosphatase 2A,"Women gain weight and their diabetes risk increases as they transition through menopause; these changes can be partly reversed by hormone therapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating these effects are unknown. A novel knock-in mouse line with the selective blockade of the membrane-initiated estrogen receptor (ER) pathway was used, and we found that the lack of this pathway precipitated excessive weight gain and glucose intolerance independent of food intake and that this was accompanied by impaired adaptive thermogenesis and reduced physical activity. Notably, the central activation of protein phosphatase (PP) 2A improved metabolic disorders induced by the lack of membrane-initiated ER signaling. Furthermore, the antiobesity effect of estrogen replacement in a murine menopause model was abolished by central PP2A inactivation. These findings define a critical role for membrane-initiated ER signaling in metabolic homeostasis via the central action of PP2A."
437007700054,NANOSCALE,Temperature responsive nanoparticles: poloxamers as a modulator of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET),"An effective strategy to control the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) of a donor/acceptor emitter pair that were attached to a 60 nm poly(propargyl acrylate)(PA) nanoparticle using temperature variations was developed. The size dependent properties of a poly-(ethylene oxide)-poly-(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) block copolymer (poloxamer) was exploited to vary the spatial separation of the emitters and vary the FRET efficiency. Specifically, a 2% change in FRET efficiency between the donor/acceptor pair was achieved per 1 degrees C change in temperature from 49 degrees C to 60 degrees C when using a poloxamer of 2950 g mol(-1) molecular weight, with sections of PPO consisting of 32 repeat units, PEO sections consisting of 12 repeat units and a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 58 degrees C. The methodology presented in this effort is easily extended to other temperature regimes through a judicious choice in poloxamer and corresponding LCST."
430452700067,MEASUREMENT,Interval data fusion with preference aggregation,"It is proposed in the paper the interval data fusion procedure intended for determination of an interval to be consistent with maximal number of given initial intervals (not necessary consistent among each other) and to be with maximal likelihood including a value x* that can serve as representative of all the given intervals. An algorithm of the interval fusion with preference aggregation (IF & PA) is proposed and discussed that can be carried out with help of representation of intervals on the real line by weak order relations (or rankings) over a set of discrete values belonging to these intervals. It is possible to determine a consensus ranking for collection of discrete values rankings, corresponding to initial intervals. The highest ranked value, accepted as a result of the fusion, guarantees improved accuracy and robustness of the interval data fusion procedure outputs. It is considered a space of weak orders induced by the intervals, its properties and dimension. A reasonable number choice problem of discrete values, representing the interval data, is investigated. Related to the problem, computing experiment results and recommendations are given. The interval data fusion procedures can be widely applied in interlaboratory comparisons, prediction of fundamental constant values on the base of different measured values, conformity testing, enhancement of multisensor readings accuracy in sensor networks, etc."
424820800003,NEUROPATHOLOGY,Clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of pediatric meningiomas,"Molecular and clinical characteristics of pediatric meningiomas are poorly defined. Therefore, we analyzed clinical, morphological and molecular profiles of pediatric meningiomas. Forty pediatric meningiomas from January 2002 to June 2015 were studied. 1p36, 14q32 and 22q-deletion were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and mutations of most relevant exons of AKT, SMO, KLF4, TRAF and pTERT using sequencing. Expression of GAB1, stathmin, progesterone receptor (PR), p53 along with MIB-1 LI was examined using immunohistochemistry. There were 36 sporadic and four NF2 associated meningiomas. Among sporadic meningiomas, the majority (72.2%) of cases harbored 22q-deletion. Difference in frequency of combined 1p/14q deletion in Grade-I versus Grade-II/III tumors was not significant (13.7% vs 28.5%, P=0.57). PR immunoreactivity was seen in 65.5% of Grade-I and 14.2% of Grade-II/III tumors (P=0.03). The majority (97.2%) of meningiomas were immunonegative for p53. Stathmin and GAB co-expression was observed in 58.3% of cases. Notably, AKT, SMO, KLF4, TRAF7 (exon 17) and pTERT mutations were seen in none of the cases analyzed. 1p/14q codeletion was frequent in skull base as compared to non-skull base meningiomas (23% vs 11.1%, P=0.37). All NF2 meningiomas harbored 22q-deletion and showed GAB and stathmin co-expression while none showed 1p/14q loss. Pediatric meningiomas share certain phenotypic and cytogenetic characteristics with adult counterparts, but GAB and stathmin co-expression in the majority of cases and non-significant difference in frequency of 1p/14q co-deletion between low-and high-grade meningiomas indicate an inherently aggressive nature. Characteristic AKT/SMO, KLF4/TRAF7 and pTERT genetic alterations seen in adults are distinctly absent in pediatric meningiomas."
432724900003,INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS,War is where the hearth is: gendered labor and the everyday reproduction of the geopolitical in the army reserves,"The feminized imaginary of home and hearth has long been central to the notion of soldiering as masculinist protection. Soldiering and war are not only materialized by gendered imaginaries of home and hearth though, but through everyday labors enacted within the home. Focusing on in-depth qualitative research with women partners and spouses of British Army reservists, we examine how women's everyday domestic and emotional labor enables reservists to serve, constituting hearth and home as a site through which war is made possible. As reservists - who are still overwhelmingly heterosexual men - become increasingly called upon by the state, one must consider how the changing nature of the Army's procurement of soldiers is also changing demands on women's labor. Feminist IPE scholars have shown broader trends in the outsourcing of labor to women and its privatization. Our research similarly underscores the significance of everyday gendered labor to the geopolitical. Moreover, we highlight the fragility of military power, given that women can withdraw their labor at any time. The article concludes that paying attention to women's everyday labor in the home facilitates greater understanding of one of the key sites through which war is both materialized and challenged."
454523000084,MOLECULES,Pd-Catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling of Pentafluorophenyl Esters,"Although the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of aryl esters has received significant attention, there is a lack of methods that utilize cheap and readily accessible Pd-phosphane catalysts, and can be routinely carried out with high cross-coupling selectivity. Herein, we report the first general method for the cross-coupling of pentafluorophenyl esters (pentafluorophenyl = pfp) by selective C-O acyl cleavage. The reaction proceeds efficiently using Pd(0)/phosphane catalyst systems. The unique characteristics of pentafluorophenyl esters are reflected in the fully selective cross-coupling vs. phenolic esters. Of broad synthetic interest, this report establishes pentafluorophenyl esters as new, highly reactive, bench-stable, economical, ester-based, electrophilic acylative reagents via acyl-metal intermediates. Mechanistic studies strongly support a unified reactivity scale of acyl electrophiles by C(O)-X (X = N, O) activation. The reactivity of pfp esters can be correlated with barriers to isomerization around the C(acyl)-O bond."
454372500009,CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY,Identification of a novel de novo gain-of-function mutation of PIK3CD in a patient with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome,"Activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K delta) syndrome is a newly defined and relatively common primary immunodeficiency, which is caused by heterozygous gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIK3CD or PIK3RI. Here, we report a novel de novo GOF mutation (c.1570 T > A, p.Y524N) in PIK3CD in a 6-year-old Chinese girl. The patient suffered recurrent sinopulmonary infection, bronchiectasis, lymphoproliferation, herpesvirus infection, and distinctive nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of mucosal surfaces. Immunological analysis revealed increased CD4 + T cell senescence and B cell immaturity. Further analysis revealed an increase in almost all CD4 + T cell subsets to varying degrees, including effector T cells and Treg cells. Increased levels of plasma T cell-related cytokines corroborated these results. Hyperactivation of the PI3K delta-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway was also confirmed. Treatment with rapamycin ameliorated the lymphoproliferative immunodeficiency caused by hyperactivation of mTOR. These results expand genetic spectrum of APDS and will facilitate further study of the genotype-phenotype correlation in those with PIK3CD mutations."
443261300049,MATERIALS LETTERS,Antibacterial activity of decahedral cinnamon nanoparticles prepared in honey using PLAL technique,"Presence of rich bioactive compounds (polyphenol, cinnamaldehyde and flavanols) in cinnamon make them greatly beneficial for biomedicinal and food applications. Considering such prospects, we prepared decahedral cinnamon nanoparticles (DCNPs) in pure honey via pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) technique at varied laser ablation energy (LAE, 0-180 mJ) and characterized. LAE dependent structure and morphology of such DCNPs were determined. DCNPs grown at LAE of 90 mJ manifested the best size distribution with average diameter of 17.08 +/- 4.71 nm. Furthermore, bactericidal traits of these DCNPs against Escherichia coli (EC) and Bacillus subtilis (BS) bacterial strains were assessed using agar well diffusion and optical density analyses. The DCNPs assisted inhibition zone diameter-antibiotic tested against such bacterial strains was remarkably enlarged. The proposed DCNPs were shown to be effective for the development of future nanomedicine. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
424853800025,PATTERN RECOGNITION,A novel localized and second order feature coding network for image recognition,"Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptor (VLAD) is a very popular feature coding method in image classification and image retrieval. Recently, the original VLAD method is extended to an end-to-end model called NetVLAD. The NetVLAD layer is readily embedded into a deep neural network and can be trained by the back-propagation algorithm. Although the NetVLAD model has achieved noticeable classification results in many image databases, the discrimination embedded in the NetVLAD method is not fully exploited. In this paper, in order to design a more discriminative feature coding network, a novel localized and second-order VLAD Network (LSO-VLADNet) is proposed. First, we design a localized and second-order VLAD coding method. Second, the back propagation functions of all newly designed layers are obtained. Third, the new feature coding method is extended to an end-to-end feature coding network which can be jointly trained with a deep convolutional neural network for visual recognition. Some experiments show that the newly designed network has the significant improvements over the original NetVLAD. Some experimental comparisons of the proposed model and other state-of-art methods will also be given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Network-layer accountability is considered as an effective deterrence tool which can be used to address these attacks. Much research has been devoted to improving network-layer accountability of today's Internet. In this paper, we first investigate the state-of-the-art network-layer accountability research and summarize a general definition of network-layer accountability. Next, we propose a network-layer accountability framework and present a taxonomy of network-layer accountability protocols according to accountability granularity. Furthermore, we compare these protocols and discuss their pros and cons mainly from accountability function, deployability, and security. Finally, some open research questions are emphasized for directing future designs."

It is shown that Ni3B additions promote the formation of a multiphase microheterogeneous matrix-reinforced structure consisting of chromium steel and solid inclusions of complex chromium-iron carbides such as Me7C (3) and Me23C6. When the doping content increases from 3.5 to 7.0 wt.%, complex Fe-Cr carbides and carboborides form, decreasing the hardness and bending strength and increasing the abrasive wear resistance of the base material from 5.0 to 12.2 km/mm. The Fe-35% FKh800 materials containing 5-7 wt. % Ni3B are found to be promising as they combine acceptable mechanical properties and improved abrasive wear resistance."
433068400003,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Molecular basis of dimer formation during the biosynthesis of benzofluorene-containing atypical angucyclines,"Lomaiviticin A and difluostatin A are benzofluorene-containing aromatic polyketides in the atypical angucycline family. Although these dimeric compounds are potent antitumor agents, how nature constructs their complex structures remains poorly understood. Herein, we report the discovery of a number of fluostatin type dimeric aromatic polyketides with varied C-C and C-N coupling patterns. We also demonstrate that these dimers are not true secondary metabolites, but are instead derived from non-enzymatic deacylation of biosynthetic acyl fluostatins. The non-enzymatic deacylation proceeds via a transient quinone methide like intermediate which facilitates the subsequent C-C/C-N coupled dimerization. Characterization of this unusual property of acyl fluostatins explains how dimerization takes place, and suggests a strategy for the assembly of C-C and C-N coupled aromatic polyketide dimers. Additionally, a deacylase FlsH was identified which may help to prevent accumulation of toxic quinone methides by catalyzing hydrolysis of the acyl group."

448533400011,COGNITION TECHNOLOGY & WORK,A resources model for distributed sensemaking,"In the field of naturalistic decision making, the data-frame model (DFM) has proven to be a popular and useful way of thinking about sensemaking. DFM provides a parsimonious account of how sensemakers' interact with the data in their environment to make sense of what is happening. In this paper, however, we argue that it is useful to elaborate DFM in several ways. We begin by arguing for the idea of sensemaking as a quest for coherence, an idea that we see as consistent with the DFM. We then present some examples of sensemaking studies and use these to motivate a distributed resources' model of sensemaking. This model uses the notion of resources for action, as resources that can be flexibly drawn upon in both choosing courses of action and accounting for the actions of oneself and of others (as opposed to prescriptions or mechanisms that determine behaviour in any strict way). The modeldescribes resources involved in sensemaking in terms of three domains: knowledge and beliefs, values and goals, and action. Knowledge and beliefs are concerned with how things are,values and goals are concerned with how things are desired to be and action provides the means for redressing the gap. Central to the model is the idea that these resources can be distributed across a cognitive work system including actors and representational media. Hence, the model aims to provide a framework for analysing sensemaking as distributed cognition."
442311600005,MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY,Increased cardiac and stroke death risk in the first year after discontinuation of postmenopausal hormone therapy,"Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of cardiac and stroke deaths in women who discontinue postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT). Methods: We analyzed the risk of death due to cardiac (n = 5,204) and cerebrovascular (n = 3,434) causes in Finnish women who discontinued systemic HT during 1994 to 2013 (n = 432,775). The risks were compared with those in the age-matched female background population and with those in age-matched HT users. Women diagnosed with cardiac or cerebrovascular events within 1 year before discontinuation of HT were excluded (n = 8,711). Results: Women younger than 60 years at discontinuation of HT showed a significantly increased risk of cardiac death (after <= 5 y of HT exposure, standardized mortality ratio [SMR] 1.52, 95% CI 1.13-2.00; after >5 y of exposure, SMR 2.08, 95% CI 1.44-2.90) and stroke death (after <= 5 y of exposure, SMR 2.62, 95% CI 2.07-3.28; after >5 y of exposure, SMR 3.22, 95% CI 2.29-4.40) during the first year after treatment as compared with age-matched female background population. When compared with HT users, elevations in risks of cardiac and stroke deaths were even higher. Increased mortality risks were limited to the first post-HT year because increases in risks vanished or markedly decreased when the follow-up time was extended over more than 1 year. Conclusions: Discontinuation of postmenopausal HT may be associated with increased risk of cardiac and stroke death in the first posttreatment year. Further investigation is required to evaluate causality of the observed associations."
424752200046,COMPOSITE STRUCTURES,Progressive matrix cracking master curves of mid and outer off-axis plies in CFRP laminates,"An energy based criteria is developed to predict the propagation of mid and outer-ply matrix cracks in laminates of type [0(n)/theta(m)]s and [theta(m)/0(n)](s) with subject to uniaxial tensile loading. Numerous specimens with 14 different layups are tested and optical microscopy is implemented to detect matrix cracks during tensile tests. Matrix cracking master curve is plotted for over 300 data points obtained from experimental observation of all tested layups. A single critical energy release rate G(mc) is derived for off-axis and transverse ply cracking in contrast to previous studies which only included transverse plies. Crack densities of all tested layups are analytically predicted and compared to experimentally obtained crack densities. For the first time in the literature, critical energy release rate is confirmed to be a material property independent of laminate layup as far as analytical predictions of matrix crack densities are in accordance with experimental observations."
451691600018,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY,Regenerative response of different regions of Drosophila imaginal discs,"Thanks to the introduction of new methods to induce massive damage under controlled conditions, much information about regeneration in Drosophila imaginal discs has accumulated in recent years. In this review, we discuss results concerning primarily the wing disc, putting emphasis on the different regenerative responses of the wing appendage, which exhibits a robust regenerative potential, and the trunk region, the notum, which regenerates very poorly. The wing disc may be a paradigm of a tissue in which a common original lineage generates cells with distinct regenerative potential. We argue that a key factor in those differences is the activity of the Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway, which functions differently in the appendage and the body trunk."

Motivated by the study of the Jacobian Conjecture, we prove that the set of non-properness of f is covered by parametric curves of degree at most . This bound is best possible. Moreover, we prove that if is a closed algebraic set covered by parametric curves, and is a generically finite polynomial map, then the set of non-properness of f is also covered by parametric curves. Moreover, if X is covered by parametric curves of degree at most , and the map f has degree , then the set is covered by parametric curves of degree at most . As an application of this result we show a real version of the Biaynicki-Birula theorem: Let G be a real, non-trivial, connected, unipotent group which acts effectively and polynomially on a connected smooth algebraic variety . Then the set Fix(G) of fixed points has no isolated points."
429187500083,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Evidence of niche partitioning among bacteria living on plastics, organic particles and surrounding seawaters","Plastic pollution is widespread in ocean ecosystems worldwide, but it is unknown if plastic offers a unique habitat for bacteria compared to communities in the water column and attached to naturally-occurring organic particles. The large set of samples taken during the Tara-Mediterranean expedition revealed for the first time a clear niche partitioning between free-living (FL), organic particle-attached (PA) and the recently introduced plastic marine debris (PMD). Bacterial counts in PMD presented higher cell enrichment factors than generally observed for PA fraction, when compared to FL bacteria in the surrounding waters. Taxonomic diversity was also higher in the PMD communities, where higher evenness indicated a favorable environment for a very large number of species. Cyanobacteria were particularly overrepresented in PMD, together with essential functions for biofilm formation and maturation. The community distinction between the three habitats was consistent across the large-scale sampling in the Western Mediterranean basin. 'Plastic specific bacteria' recovered only on the PMD represented half of the OTUs, thus forming a distinct habitat that should be further considered for understanding microbial biodiversity in changing marine ecosystems.

Towards a new fungal red colorant for the food industry,"The interest about red color in the food industry has been growing because of its wide application in variety of foods and beverages and also due to the carcinogenic and teratogenic effects of some synthetic colorants. Many ascomycetous fungi naturally synthesize and secrete pigments and thus provide readily available additional and/or alternative sources of natural colorants that are independent of agro-climatic conditions. Some species of Talaromyces produce large amounts of Monascus-like azaphilone red pigments without any toxins. In this study, Talaromyces albobiverticillius 30548 was isolated from the outer slope of the coral reef of the Reunion Island, Indian Ocean. The biosynthesized intracellular and extracellular pigments were extracted by successive cold extractions or by single solvent extraction methods The pigments were then analyzed by HPLC-PDA-ESI/MS system in positive and negative ionization modes. Twelve different compounds were detected and four were tentatively identified as Monascus-type pigments, based on the results obtained and the available literature. In particular, N-threonine-monascorubramine, N-glutaryl-rubropunctamine and PP-O were tentatively identified; further, this work reports for the first time on the PDA, MS and NMR characterization of the here named as N-GABA-PP-V (6-[(Z)-2-Carboxyvinyl]-N-GABA-PP-V) pigment bearing a cis configuration at the C10-C11 double bond, in Talaromyces albobiverticillius 30548."
429542000012,APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,EXPLORING NATURAL VARIATION OF ROOT ARCHITECTURAL TRAITS IN SEEDLINGS OF MAIZE HYBRID AND INBRED LINES FROM THAILAND,"Root architectural traits refer to a spatial configuration of the root system providing a critical role in soil resource acquisition. In past decades, several lines of evidence have shown that maize possesses large phenotypic variations, including root architecture closely relating to physiological utility. Thailand has developed a unique maize germplasm over the years; however, root traits have often been neglected and have yet to be explored. In this present study, we examined natural variation of root architectural traits of twenty-eight inbred and hybrid lines at the seedling stage using a well-established roll-up culture system. We found that variation in root traits ranged from 4.22-fold in primary roots to 13.14-fold in seminal root length, while shoot mass presented the highest phenotypic variation among traits (23.42-fold). Most root architectural traits of maize hybrid lines were significantly higher than the inbred lines, particularly, seminal root length, which was 34.30% greater than that of inbred lines. In addition, we found that root traits, like other agronomic traits, express heterosis. Our findings suggest ample opportunity for incorporating root traits in maize breeding program in Thailand."
439930200003,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING,A novel scaled boundary finite element formulation with stabilization and its application to image-based elastoplastic analysis,"Digital images are increasingly being used as input data for computational analyses. This study presents an efficient numerical technique to perform image-based elastoplastic analysis of materials and structures. The quadtree decomposition algorithm is employed for image-based mesh generation, which is fully automatic and highly efficient. The quadtree cells are modeled by scaled boundary polytope elements, which eliminate the issue of hanging nodes faced by standard finite elements. A novel, simple, and efficient scaled boundary elastoplastic formulation with stablisation is developed. In this formulation, the return-mapping calculation is only required to be performed at a single point in a polytope element, which facilitates the computational efficiency of the elastoplastic analysis and simplicity of implementation. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed technique for performing the elastoplastic analysis of high-resolution images."
431075600018,PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER,Anomalous magnetotransport properties of high-quality single crystals of Weyl semimetal WTe2: Sign change of Hall resistivity,"We report on a systematic study of Hall effect using high quality single crystals of type-II Weyl semimetal WTe2 with the applied magnetic field B//c. The residual resistivity ratio of 1330 and the large magnetoresistance of 1.5 x 10(6) % in 9 T at 2 K, being in the highest class in the literature, attest to their high quality. Based on a simple two-carrier model, the densities (n(e) and n(h)) and mobilities (mu(e) and mu(h)) for electron and hole carriers have been uniquely determined combining both Hall-and electrical-resistivity data. The difference between ne and nh is similar to 1% at 2 K, indicating that the system is in an compensated condition. The negative Hall resistivity growing rapidly below similar to 20 K is due to a rapidly increasing mu(h)/mu(e) approaching one. Below 3 K in a low field region, we found the Hall resistivity becomes positive, reflecting that mu(h)/mu(e) finally exceeds one in this region. These anomalous behaviors of the carrier densities and mobilities might be associated with the existence of a Lifshitz transition and/or the spin texture on the Fermi surface."
431961900001,IEEE ACCESS,Disparity Estimation for Camera Arrays Using Reliability Guided Disparity Propagation,"Light field cameras become increasingly popular recently, as they can capture 3-D geometry of the scene in a single snap-shot. Many post-capture adjustments can be realized after the disparity map or the equivalent depth map being estimated. Recent studies about light field depth recovery are more designed for commercial microlens cameras, such as Lytro and Raytrix. However, camera arrays capture scenes with sparser angular samplings and lower angular resolution than microlens cameras. When previous approaches are employed, there will be larger noise and more depth ambiguities in the estimated disparity map, especially, in the textureless regions. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the disparity from camera arrays. The local disparity with the corresponding reliability is first computed by analyzing the angular variance of the input sub-images. We further optimize the local disparity map by introducing a novel prior and inferring the corresponding implementation algorithm named reliability guided disparity propagation (RGDP). With the global optimization using RGDP, a high-quality disparity map can be generated with noise being suppressed and edges being protected. We conduct experiments on both public data sets and real-world scenes. The effectiveness and outperformance of our method are demonstrated as compared with other state-of-the-art methods."
428251900022,JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH,Reading Behind the Lines: The Factors Affecting the Text Reception Threshold in Hearing Aid Users,"Purpose: The visual Text Reception Threshold (TRT) test (Zekveld et al., 2007) has been designed to assess modality-general factors relevant for speech perception in noise. In the last decade, the test has been adopted in audiology labs worldwide. The 1st aim of this study was to examine which factors best predict interindividual differences in the TRT. Second, we aimed to assess the relationships between the TRT and the speech reception thresholds (SRTs) estimated in various conditions. Method: First, we reviewed studies reporting relationships between the TRT and the auditory and/or cognitive factors and formulated specific hypotheses regarding the TRT predictors. These hypotheses were tested using a prediction model applied to a rich data set of 180 hearing aid users. In separate association models, we tested the relationships between the TRT and the various SRTs and subjective hearing difficulties, while taking into account potential confounding variables. Results: The results of the prediction model indicate that the TRT is predicted by the ability to fill in missing words in incomplete sentences, by lexical access speed, and by working memory capacity. Furthermore, in line with previous studies, a moderate association between higher age, poorer pure-tone hearing acuity, and poorer TRTs was observed. Better TRTs were associated with better SRTs for the correct perception of 50% of Hagerman matrix sentences in a 4-talker babble, as well as with better subjective ratings of speech perception. Age and pure-tone hearing thresholds significantly confounded these associations. The associations of the TRT with SRTs estimated in other conditions and with subjective qualities of hearing were not statistically significant when adjusting for age and pure-tone average. Conclusions: We conclude that the abilities tapped into by the TRT test include processes relevant for speeded lexical decision making when completing partly masked sentences and that these processes require working memory capacity. Furthermore, the TRT is associated with the SRT of hearing aid users as estimated in a challenging condition that includes informational masking and with experienced difficulties with speech perception in daily-life conditions. The current results underline the value of using the TRT test in studies involving speech perception and aid in the interpretation of findings acquired using the test."

Metal complexes of tin, antimony and iron were synthesized and characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. The antibacterial and antioxidant activities were performed for these complexes, which revealed that the metal complexes synthesized are more potent than their parent compounds. We observed that antioxidant activity showed by triphenyltin complex was significant and least activity have been shown by antimony trichloride complex. The synthesized metal complexes were then evaluated against two Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacterial strains. Triphenyl tin complex emerged as potent antibacterial agent with MIC value of 8 mu g/ml each against Shigellaspp, Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus. While, the MIC value against Streptococcus pneumoniae is 4 mu g/ml. Computational docking studies were carried out on molecular targets to interpret the results of antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Based on the results, it may be inferred that the metal complexes of ursolic acid are more active as compared to the parent drug and may be proved for some other pharmacological potential by further analysis."

450660300038,DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES,Incidence and Prognosis of Subsequent Cholangiocarcinoma in Patients with Hepatic Resection for Bile Duct Stones,"Background and AimCholangiocarcinoma (CCA) often develops after the hepatic resection for hepatolithiasis as well as indwelling it. We studied the incidence and prognosis of subsequent CCA in patients with hepatolithiasis in South Korea.MethodsWe identified individuals with diagnosed CCA at the time of or after surgery, during 2002-2016, from the Korean National Health Insurance. The incidences and survival rates of subsequent CCA were analyzed and compared with concomitant CCA. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of CCA in this cohort were evaluated in the standard Korean population. All data were stratified by the presence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA, age and sex.ResultsOf the 7852 patients with hepatectomy for BDS, 433 (5.84%) had concomitant CCA. Over the 12-year follow-up, 107 of 7419 (1.98%) patients were diagnosed with subsequent CCA. Patients with hepatic resection for BDS revealed higher SIRs for subsequent CCA (12.89, 95% CI 10.96-15.15) in cases of both intrahepatic CCA (13.40, 10.55-17.02) and extrahepatic CCA (12.42, 9.98-15.46). The median survival time for subsequent CCA was 0.87years, while that for concomitant CCA was 2.79years. Having subsequent CCA (HR 2.71, 95% CI 2.17-3.40) and being male (HR 1.28, 1.05-1.57) were related to a shorter survival time. The CCA site and age at CCA diagnosis were not related to prognoses.ConclusionsSubsequent CCA developed in 2% of the patients with hepatic resection for benign BDS until 10years and was associated with poorer prognoses than concomitant CCA. Future studies focused on the long-term surveillance for CCA in such patients are needed."
445108100018,TOBACCO CONTROL,Revealing the complexity of quitting smoking: a qualitative grounded theory study of the natural history of quitting in Australian ex-smokers,"Objective To explore the quitting histories of Australian ex-smokers in order to develop an understanding of the varied contribution of smoking cessation assistance (either pharmacotherapy or professionally mediated behavioural support) to the process of quitting. Design Qualitative grounded theory study; in-depth interviews. Participants 37 Australian adult ex-smokers (24-68 years; 15 men, 22 women) who quit in the past 6-24 months. Results Although participants' individual quitting histories and their overall experiences of quitting were unique, when the 37 quitting histories were compared it was clear two experiences were common to almost all participants: almost no one quit at their first quit attempt and almost everyone started out quitting unassisted. Furthermore, distinct patterns existed in the timing and use of assistance, in particular the age at which assistance was first used, how some participants were resolutely uninterested in assistance, and how assistance might have contributed to the process of successful quitting even if not used on the final quit attempt. Importantly, three patterns in use of assistance were identified: (1) only ever tried to quit unassisted (n=13); (2) started unassisted, tried assistance but reverted back to unassisted (n=13); (3) started unassisted, tried assistance and quit with assistance (n=11). For most participants, insight into what quitting would require was only gained through prior quitting experiences with and without assistance. For a number of participants, interest in assistance was at its lowest when the participant was most ready to quit. Conclusion Quitting should be viewed as a process drawing on elements of assisted and unassisted quitting rather than a stand-alone event that can be labelled as strictly assisted or unassisted."
430010500015,PLANT BIOLOGY,Orchid seed removal by ants in Neotropical ant-gardens,"Most plants that inhabit ant-gardens (AGs) are cultivated by the ants. Some orchids occur in AGs; however, it is not known whether their seeds are dispersed by AG ants because most orchid seeds are tiny and dispersed by wind. We performed insitu seed removal experiments, in which we simultaneously provided Azteca gnava ants with seeds of three AG orchid species and three other AG epiphyte species (Bromeliaceae, Cactaceae and Gesneriaceae), as well as the non-AG orchid Catasetum integerrimum. The seeds most removed were those of the bromeliad Aechmea tillandsioides and the gesneriad Codonanthe uleana, while seeds of AG orchids Coryanthes picturata, Epidendrum flexuosum and Epidendrum pachyrachis were less removed. The non-AG orchid was not removed. Removal values were positively correlated with the frequency of the AG epiphytes in the AGs, and seeds of AG orchids were larger than those of non-AG orchids, which should favour myrmecochory. Our data show that Azt. gnava ants discriminate and preferentially remove seeds of the AG epiphytes. We report for the first time the removal of AG orchid seeds by AG ants in Neotropical AGs."
449916400001,JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION,A Comparison Analysis of Surrogate Safety Measures with Car-Following Perspectives for Advanced Driver Assistance System,"Surrogate Safety Measure (SSM) is one of the most widely used methods for identifying future threats, such as rear-end collision. Various SSMs have been proposed for the application of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), including Forward Collision Warning System (FCWS) and Emergency Braking System (EBS). The existing SSMs have been mainly used for assessing criticality of a certain traffic situation or detecting critical actions, such as severe braking maneuvers and jerking before an accident. The ADAS shows different warning signals or movements from drivers' driving behaviours depending on the SSM employed in the system, which may lead to low reliability and low satisfaction. In order to explore the characteristics of existing SSMs in terms of human driving behaviours, this study analyzes collision risks estimated by three different SSMs, including Time-To-Collision (TTC), Stopping headway Distance (SHD), and Deceleration-based Surrogate Safety Measure (DSSM), based on two different car-following theories, such as action point model and asymmetric driving behaviour model. 'Ihe results show that the estimated collision risks of the TTC and SHD only partially match the pattern of human driving behaviour. Furthermore, the TTC and SHD overestimate the collision risk in deceleration process, particularly when the subject vehicle is faster than its preceding vehicle. On the other hand, the DSSM shows well-matched results to the pattern of the human driving behaviour. It well represents the collision risk even when the preceding vehicle moves faster than the follower one. Moreover, unlike other SSMs, the DSSM shows a balanced performance to estimate the collision risk in both deceleration and acceleration phase. These research findings suggest that the DSSM has a great potential to enhance the driver's compliance to the ADAS, since it can reflect how the driver perceives the collision risks according to the driving behaviours in the car-following situation."

Considered as a model is a periodic superlattice with cells consisting of a quantum well and a layer of metal nanoparticles. The problem is solved self-consistently using the electrodynamic Green's functions taking account of resonant polarization. Coulomb plasmon-exciton interaction is associated with the dipole surface plasmons of particles and their image charges due to excitonic polarization of neighboring quantum well. Optical reflection spectra are numerically investigated for superlattices with GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells and silver nanoparticles. Superradiant regime caused by one-dimensional Bragg diffraction is studied for plasmonic, excitonic and plasmon-excitonic polaritons depending on the number of supercells. The plasmon-excitonic Rabi splitting is shown to occur in reflectivity spectra of resonant Bragg structures."

Surprisingly little is known rigorously about the enumeration of self-avoiding polygons, although there are numerous conjectures that are believed to be true and strongly supported by numerical simulations. As an analogous problem to this study, we consider multiple self-avoiding polygons in a confined region as a model for multiple ring polymers in physics. We find rigorous lower and upper bounds for the number p(mxn) of distinct multiple self-avoiding polygons in the m x n rectangular grid on the square lattice. For m = 2, p(2xn) = 2(n-1) - 1. And for integers m, n >= 3, 2(m+n-3) (17/10)((m -2) (n-2)) <= p(mxn) <= 2(m+n-3) (13/16)((m-2) (n-2))."

427600800015,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,Anti-sFlt-1 Therapy Preserves Lung Alveolar and Vascular Growth in Antenatal Models of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,"Rationale: Pregnancies complicated by antenatal stress, including preeclampsia (PE) and chorioamnionitis (CA), increase the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, but biologic mechanisms linking prenatal factors with BPD are uncertain. Levels of sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1), an endogenous antagonist to VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), are increased in amniotic fluid and maternal blood in PE and associated with CA. Objectives: Because impaired VEGF signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD, we hypothesized that fetal exposure to sFlt-1 decreases lung growth and causes abnormal lung structure and pulmonary hypertension during infancy. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of anti-sFlt-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment on lung growth in two established antenatal models of BPD that mimic PE and CA induced by intraamniotic (i.a.) injections of sFlt-1 or endotoxin, respectively. In experimental PE, mAb was administered by three different approaches, including antenatal treatment by either i.a. instillation or maternal uterine artery infusion, or by postnatal intraperitoneal injections. Results: With each strategy, mAb therapy improved infant lung structure as assessed by radial alveolar count, vessel density, right ventricular hypertrophy, and lung function. As found in the PE model, the adverse lung effects of i.a. endotoxin were also reduced by antenatal or postnatal mAb therapy. Conclusions: We conclude that treatment with anti-sFlt-1 mAb preserves lung structure and function and prevents right ventricular hypertrophy in two rat models of BPD of antenatal stress and speculate that early mAb therapy may provide a novel strategy for the prevention of BPD."

Thus, two experiments were conducted in a greenhouse, and two were conducted in naturally infested fields. Both fungi were efficient in controlling the nematode when they were applied alone, whereas the combination of the two did not improve nematode control. However, the addition of a bioactivator (moss) to the combination of fungi (P.lilacinum+T.harzianum+moss) generally promoted better control of the nematode in the greenhouse, with a reduction in the total abundance of the nematode ranging from 57.1% to 73.75%, and under field conditions, with a reduction ranging from 55.5% to 72.0%. The same treatment increased yield in both field experiments, but the treatment with T.harzianum promoted greater gains in productivity, varying from 11.79% to 20.85%."
419920900001,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Self-face Captures, Holds, and Biases Attention","The implicit self-recognition process may take place already in the pre-attentive stages of perception. After a silent stimulus has captured attention, it is passed on to the attentive stage where it can affect decision making and responding. Numerous studies show that the presence of self-referential information affects almost every cognitive level. These effects may share a common and fundamental basis in an attentional mechanism, conceptualized as attentional bias: the exaggerated deployment of attentional resources to a salient stimulus. A gold standard in attentional bias research is the dot-probe paradigm. In this task, a prominent stimulus (cue) and a neutral stimulus are presented in different spatial locations, followed by the presentation of a target. In the current study we aimed at investigating whether the self-face captures, holds and biases attention when presented as a task-irrelevant stimulus. In two dot-probe experiments coupled with the event-related potential (ERP) technique we analyzed the following relevant ERPs components: N2pc and SPCN which reflect attentional shifts and the maintenance of attention, respectively. An inter-stimulus interval separating face-cues and probes (800ms) was introduced only in the first experiment. In line with our predictions, in Experiment 1 the self-face elicited the N2pc and the SPCN component. In Experiment 2 in addition to N2pc, an attentional bias was observed. Our results indicate that unintentional self-face processing disables the top-down control setting to filter out distractors, thus leading to the engagement of attentional resources and visual short-term memory."
454439900002,FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,Highly Heterogeneous Excitatory Connections Require Less Amount of Noise to Sustain Firing Activities in Cortical Networks,"Cortical networks both in vivo and in vitro sustain asynchronous irregular firings with extremely low frequency. To realize such self-sustained activity in neural network models, balance between excitatory and inhibitory activities is known to be one of the keys. In addition, recent theoretical studies have revealed that another feature commonly observed in cortical networks, i.e., sparse but strong connections and dense weak connections, plays an essential role. The previous studies, however, have not thoroughly considered the cooperative dynamics between a network of such heterogeneous synaptic connections and intrinsic noise. The noise stimuli, representing inherent nature of the neuronal activities, e.g., variability of presynaptic discharges, should be also of significant importance for sustaining the irregular firings in cortical networks. Here, we numerically demonstrate that highly heterogeneous distribution, typically a lognormal type, of excitatory-to-excitatory connections, reduces the amount of noise required to sustain the network firing activities. In the sense that noise consumes an energy resource, the heterogeneous network receiving less amount of noise stimuli is considered to realize an efficient dynamics in cortex. A noise-driven network of bi-modally distributed synapses further shows that many weak and a few very strong synapses are the key feature of the synaptic heterogeneity, supporting the network firing activity."
441792600004,JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES,Clinical Features of Human Metapneumovirus Pneumonia in Non-Immunocompromised Patients: An Investigation of Three Long-Term Care Facility Outbreaks,"Background. Several studies have reported outbreaks due to human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in long-term care facilities (LTCF) for the elderly. However, most of these reports are epidemiological studies and do not investigate the clinical features of hMPV pneumonia. Methods. Three independent outbreaks of hMPV occurred at separate LTCF for intellectually challenged and elderly residents. A retrospective evaluation of hMPV pneumonia and its clinical and radiological features was conducted using available medical records and data. Results. In 105 hMPV infections, 49% of patients developed pneumonia. The median age of pneumonia cases was significantly higher than non-pneumonia cases (P < .001). Clinical manifestations of hMPV pneumonia included high fever, wheezing in 43%, and respiratory failure in 31% of patients. An elevated number of white blood cells as well as increased levels of C-reactive protein, creatine phosphokinase, and both aspartate and alanine transaminases was also observed among pneumonia cases. Evaluation of chest imaging revealed proximal bronchial wall thickenings radiating outward from the hilum in most patients. Conclusions. The aforementioned characteristics should be considered as representative of hMPV pneumonia. Patients presenting with these features should have laboratory testing performed for prompt diagnosis."

453307600001,MALARIA JOURNAL,Identification of a PH domain-containing protein which is localized to crystalloid bodies of Plasmodium ookinetes,"BackgroundFor the success of the malaria control and eradication programme it is essential to reduce parasite transmission by mosquito vectors. In the midguts of mosquitoes fed with parasite-infected blood, sexual-stage parasites fertilize to develop into motile ookinetes that traverse midgut epithelial cells and reside adjacent the basal lamina. Therefore, the ookinete is a promising target of transmission-blocking vaccines to break the parasite lifecycle in mosquito vectors. However, the molecular mechanisms of ookinete formation and invasion of epithelial cells have not been fully elucidated. A unique structure called the crystalloid body has been identified in the ookinete cytoplasm by electron microscopy, but its biological functions remain unclear.MethodsA recombinant protein of a novel molecule, designated as crystalloid body specific PH domain-containing protein of Plasmodium yoelii (PyCryPH), was synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free system. Specific rabbit antibodies against PyCryPH were obtained to characterize the expression and localization of PyCryPH during sexual-stage parasite development. In addition, PyCryPH knockout parasites were generated by targeted gene disruption to examine PyCryPH function in mosquito-stage parasite development.ResultsWestern blot and immunofluorescence assays using specific antibodies showed that PyCryPH is specifically expressed in zygotes and ookinetes. By immunoelectron microscopy it was demonstrated that PyCryPH is localized within crystalloid bodies. Parasites with a disrupted PyCryPH gene developed normally into ookinetes and formed oocysts on the basal lamina of midguts. In addition, the number of sporozoites residing in salivary glands was comparable to that of wild-type parasites.ConclusionsCryPH, containing a signal peptide and PH domain, is predominantly expressed in zygotes and ookinetes and is localized to crystalloid bodies in P. yoelii. CryPH accumulates in vesicle-like structures prior to the appearance of typical crystalloid bodies. Unlike other known crystalloid body localized proteins, CryPH does not appear to have a multiple domain architecture characteristic of the LAP/CCp family proteins. Although CryPH is highly conserved among Plasmodium, Babesia, Theileria, and Cryptosporidium, PyCryPH is dispensable for the development of invasive ookinetes and sporozoites in mosquito bodies."

434895300023,INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH,Spectroscopic Investigation of Enhanced Adsorption of U(VI) and Eu(III) on Magnetic Attapulgite in Binary System,"The coadsorption of uranium and europium on magnetic attapulgite (M-ATT) was explored through batch experiments and spectroscopic tests. The adsorption processes of U(VI) and Eu(III) onto M-ATT were highly affected by the solution pH but not by the ionic strength, indicating that the adsorption of the two metals was predominated through inner-sphere surface complexation. Adsorption isotherms demonstrated that the maximum adsorption capacities of U(VI) on M-ATT in the single-solute system (e.g., 60.48 mg g(-1) at pH 6.0) were lower than that in the binary-solute system (e.g., 63.03 mg g(-1) at pH 6.0), and the same trend was noticed for Eu(III) adsorption due to their synergistic effect. The existence of U(VI) and U(IV) species evidenced the partial reduction of adsorbed U(Vl) to U(IV) by M-ATT based on XPS tests. Hence, the enhanced adsorption of U(VI) in the existence of Eu(III) is ascribed to the primary coadsorption and then the redox of adsorbed U(VI) to U(IV) by M-ATT, as well as the formation of new sorbent active sites derived from reductive coprecipitation (e.g., UO2+x(s)), which also increased the Eu(III) adsorption on M-ATT. The findings are significant for coadsorption of radionuclides by magnetic adsorbents in environmental pollution management."
437406200004,PEDIATRICS,Parvovirus B19: A Cause of Sepsislike Syndrome in an Infant,"Parvovirus B19 (PB19) is an important human pathogen that results in a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes, from mild, self-limiting erythema infectiosum in immunocompetent children and arthralgia in adults to lethal cytopenia in immunocompromised patients and intrauterine fetal death. However, there have been few reports of PB19 infection in neonates or young infants (aged 28-90 days), and no previous reports contained descriptions of PB19 infection as a cause of sepsislike syndrome in this age group. We report a case of sepsislike syndrome caused by PB19 infection in a 56-day-old infant whose mother had polyarthralgia at the time of his admission. PB19 infection was diagnosed on the basis of positive polymerase chain reaction results for PB19 DNA in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Positive immunoglobulin M and negative immunoglobulin G for PB19 suggested acute infection. He was admitted to the ICU because of poor peripheral circulation, but fully recovered without antibiotic administration. After excluding other possible pathogens, PB19 should be suspected as a cause of sepsislike syndrome in young infants, especially those who have close contact with PB19-infected individuals."
425652700004,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,Development of stereotactic radiosurgery using carbon beams (carbon-knife),"The aim of this research is to develop a stereotactic-radiosurgery (SRS) technique using carbon beams to treat small intracranial lesions; we call this device the carbon knife. A 2D-scanning method is adapted to broaden a pencil beam to an appropriate size for an irradiation field. A Mitsubishi slow extraction using third order resonance through a rf acceleration system stabilized by a feed-forward scanning beam using steering magnets with a 290 MeV/u initial beam energy was used for this purpose. Ridge filters for spread-out Bragg peaks (SOBPs) with widths of 5 mm, 7.5 mm, and 10 mm were designed to include fluence-attenuation effects. The collimator, which defines field shape, was used to reduce the lateral penumbra. The lateral-penumbra width at the SOBP region was less than 2 mm for the carbon knife. The penumbras behaved almost the same when changing the air gap, but on the other hand, increasing the range-shifter thickness mostly broadened the lateral penumbra. The physical-dose rates were approximate 6 Gy s(-1) and 4.5 Gy s(-1) for the 10 x 10 mm(2) and 5 x 5 mm(2) collimators, respectively."

As five-membered heterocyclic systems with such a special substitution pattern are barely known, unique synthesis routes had to be developed, which rely, e.g., on the van Leusen pyrrole synthesis and the halogen dance reaction. Synthesis and biological activity against selected Ascomycete pathogens of these difluoromethylated pyrazoline, pyrrole, and thiophene derivatives are reported. [GRAPHICS] ."
436340500026,ACS OMEGA,High Reusability of Catalytically Active Gold Nanoparticles Immobilized in Core-Shell Hydrogel Microspheres,"The reusability of hybrid core-shell microgels, whose core surfaces were decorated with gold nanoparticles, was investigated in terms of catalysis activity. Hybrid core-shell microgels composed of a rigid core and water-swollen gel shell endowed the immobilized gold nanoparticles with a high dispersion stability, which resulted in excellent catalytic activity. In contrast to free Au nanoparticles and conventional hybrid microgels, where the Au nanoparticles are randomly distributed over the entire microgel templates, the hydrogel shell part of the hybrid core-shell microgels suppressed the aggregation between the microgels and Au nanoparticles in individual microgels, which improved the reusability for the catalysis reaction. The results of this study should help to develop advanced catalyst systems that require high reusability even when the chemical reactions occur in aqueous solution and external stimuli are applied."
423677900012,JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM,Genetic mutations associated with neonatal diabetes mellitus in Omani patients,"Background: Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare disorder worldwide where diabetes is diagnosed in the first 6 months of life. However, Oman has a relatively high incidence of NDM. Methods: In this study, we investigated the genetic etiologies underlying NDM and their prevalence in Oman. We collected a cohort of 24 NDM patients, with and without genetic diagnosis, referred to our center from 2007 to 2015. All patients without a genetic diagnosis were tested for mutations in 23 NDM-associated genes using a custom-targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel and methylation analysis of the 6q24 locus. Results: A genetic abnormality was detected in 15/24 (62.5%) of our Omani NDM patients. We report the detection of 6q24 methylation abnormalities and KCNJ11 mutations for the first time in Omani NDM patients. Unlike Western populations where NDM is predominantly due to mutations in the KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS genes, NDM due to homozygous GCK gene mutations were most prevalent in Oman, having been observed in seven out of 15 NDM patients in whom we established the genetic etiology. This reflects the high degree of consanguinity which makes recessive conditions more likely. Conclusions: The results of this study are likely to impact any future strategy to introduce genetic testing for NDM disorders within the national healthcare system in Oman."
430720500010,BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS,An integrated clinical and genomic information system for cancer precision medicine,"Background: Increasing affordability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has created an opportunity for realizing genomically-informed personalized cancer therapy as a path to precision oncology. However, the complex nature of genomic information presents a huge challenge for clinicians in interpreting the patient's genomic alterations and selecting the optimum approved or investigational therapy. An elaborate and practical information system is urgently needed to support clinical decision as well as to test clinical hypotheses quickly. Results: Here, we present an integrated clinical and genomic information system (CGIS) based on NGS data analyses. Major components include modules for handling clinical data, NGS data processing, variant annotation and prioritization, drug-target-pathway analysis, and population cohort explorer. We built a comprehensive knowledgebase of genes, variants, drugs by collecting annotated information from public and in-house resources. Structured reports for molecular pathology are generated using standardized terminology in order to help clinicians interpret genomic variants and utilize them for targeted cancer therapy. We also implemented many features useful for testing hypotheses to develop prognostic markers from mutation and gene expression data. Conclusions: Our CGIS software is an attempt to provide useful information for both clinicians and scientists who want to explore genomic information for precision oncology."
456469400074,JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,In Vivo Imaging of Reactive Oxygen Species in a Murine Wound Model,"The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a hallmark of inflammatory processes, but in excess, oxidative stress is widely implicated in various pathologies such as cancer, atherosclerosis and diabetes. We have previously shown that dysfunction of the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)/ Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein 1 (Keapl) signaling pathway leads to extreme ROS imbalance during cutaneous wound healing in diabetes. Since ROS levels are an important indicator of progression of wound healing, specific and accurate quantification techniques are valuable. Several in vitro assays to measure ROS in cells and tissues have been described; however, they only provide a single cumulative measurement per sample. More recently, the development of protein-based indicators and imaging modalities have allowed for unique spatiotemporal analyses. L-012 (C13H8CIN4NaO2) is a luminol derivative that can be used for both in vivo and in vitro chemiluminescent detection of ROS generated by NAPDH oxidase. L-012 emits a stronger signal than other fluorescent probes and has been shown to be both sensitive and reliable for detecting ROS. The time lapse applicability of L-012-facilitated imaging provides valuable information about inflammatory processes while reducing the need for sacrifice and overall reducing the number of study animals. Here, we describe a protocol utilizing L-012-facilitated in vivo imaging to quantify oxidative stress in a model of excisional wound healing using diabetic mice with locally dysfunctional Nrf2/Keap1."
433014200032,JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN CERAMIC SOCIETY,On the Yttrium Tantalate - Zirconia phase diagram,"The phase diagram for the YTaO4-ZrO2 quasi-binary has been determined up to 1600 degrees C. There are three distinct compositional regimes: an extensive YTaO4 solid solution, an extensive ZrO2 solid solution and a two-phase intermediate region. The addition of ZrO2 to YTaO4 decreases the M-T transition temperature almost linearly from 1426 degrees C to approximately 450 degrees C at the solubility limit (similar to 28 mol% ZrO2 ), and then remains constant until the ZrO2 solid solution phase boundary is reached. Within the intermediate region, there exists an extensive two-phase tetragonal (T + t) phase field above the M T transformation temperature. The transformation exhibits no hysteresis on heating and cooling but nonetheless there is a distribution with temperature in the mass fraction of the monoclinic and tetragonal phases so no unique transformation temperature can be identified. No other high temperature phases were observed but it is suggested that a higher temperature solid solution phase is likely above 1700 degrees C, based on the similarity in crystallographic relationship between the two tetragonal solid solution structures."
440691800005,JOURNAL OF MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS,High Force Sensitivity Composite Nanofluidic AFM Cantilever,"The objective of this paper is to design and fabricate a low stiffness cantilever with an enclosed nanofluidic channel. This paper addresses the primary challenge of current hollow cantilever design, and introduces the use of a thermally decomposable polymer as the enabling technology to form a reduced stiffness, and thus higher sensitivity, cantilever. A numerical stiffness model is first developed to identify the critical geometric parameters necessary for structural soundness and bendability. A new sacrificial material is then introduced to cantilever fabrication that uses a low temperature top coat layer of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition nitride. Experimental measurement of the film's internal stress and the resulting bending radius of a composite cantilever are used to characterize residual stress from film deposition as a new design parameter, unique to this method, which was mitigated by a thorough analysis of the combined effect of film properties and cantilever mechanics. A numerical model is developed for optimizing cantilever geometry and refining film process parameters to minimize the internal stress of the cantilever, whilst achieving a low stiffness, high sensitivity, and composite nanofluidic atomic force microscopy cantilever."
462221000002,NETWORK-COMPUTATION IN NEURAL SYSTEMS,Fully tuned RBF neural network controller for ultrasound hyperthermia cancer tumour therapy,"Thermal dose is an important clinical efficacy index for hyperthermia cancer treatment. This paper presents a new direct radial basis function (RBF) neural network controller for high-temperature hyperthermia thermal dose during the therapeutic procedure of cancer tumours by short-time pulses of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). The developed controller is stabilized and automatically tuned based on Lyapunov functions and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, respectively. In addition, this thermal dose control system has been validated using one-dimensional (1-D) biothermal tissue model. Simulation results showed that the fully tuned RBF neural network controller outperforms other controllers in the previous studies by achieving targeted thermal dose with shortest treatment times less than 13.5min, avoiding the tissue cavitation during the thermal therapy. Moreover, the maximum value of its mean integral time absolute error (MTAE) is 98.64, which is significantly less than the resulted errors for the manual-tuned controller under the same treatment conditions of all tested cases. In this study, integrated ACO method with robust RBF neural network controller provides a successful and improved performance to deliver accurate thermal dose of hyperthermia cancer tumour treatment using the focused ultrasound transducer without external cooling effect."

A rectangular stainless steel foil (AISI-304, 0.15mm thick) used as the test surface is electrically heated to obtain the required initial temperature (500 degrees C). The distribution of surface heat flux on the target surface is evaluated from the recorded thermal images during transient cooling. The effect of nanoparticle concentration and Reynolds number of the nanofluids on the heat transfer characteristics is studied. Tests are performed for varied range of Reynolds number (5000 <= Re <= 12,000), two different CuO-water nanofluids concentration (Phi = 0.15%, 0.6%) and two different nozzle to plate distance (l/d = 6, 12). The enhancement in Nusselt number for CuO-water nanofluids was found to be 14% and 90%, for nanofluids concentration of Phi = 0.15% and Phi = 0.60%, respectively, compared to pure water. The test surface characteristics after nanofluids jet impingement are studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Based on the investigation, a correlation among various parameters, namely, Reynolds number (Re), Prandtl number (Pr), nozzle to plate distance (l/d), and Nusselt number (Nu), is presented."

419153000010,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,Screening of alternative products for integrated pest management of cucurbit powdery mildew in Sweden,"partially resistant cultivar. We conclud Cucurbit powdery mildew (CPM) is one of the most important plant protection problems in Swedish cucumber production. CPM fungi have developed resistance to the commonly used fungicide (Imazalil) rendering its current use less effective. We therefore screened a selection of alternative products, evaluating their ability to control CPM in seven small-scale, semi-commercial, greenhouse experiments. Products were screened for their ability to suppress CPM on a susceptible cultivar, in 2013. In 2015, the best treatments were tested in different combinations, in different intervals on a susceptible and a partially resistant cultivar. The treatment that gave the best CPM control was Sakalia in combination with wetting agent Yuccah, (based on Reynoutria sachaliensis and Yucca schidigera respectively) applied at 7-day intervals. This treatment was highly efficient on both cucumber cultivars. Sakalia mixed with Yuccah applied at 14-day intervals had an almost equally controlling effect on CPM. The microbial pesticides, Polyversum (Pythium oligandrum) and AQ10 (Ampelomyces quiscalis) and the fungicide Imazalil, provided no to poor control of CPM compared to control treatments. Hortistar (Silicon) partially reduced CPM infections and was more efficient on the e that Sakalia in combination with wetting agent Yuccah could efficiently control the disease even under the severe conditions caused by artificial inoculation. Further testing of this combination in commercial greenhouses will enable evaluation of the potential effects on yield and beneficial or pest insects. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to develop IPM tools for commercial production systems."
425965300021,KARDIOLOGIA POLSKA,Polish single-centre follow-up of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) systems implanted for the prevention of sudden cardiac death,"Background and aim: Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) is an effective and modern tool used to protect patients at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) from potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The first S-ICD systems were implanted in Poland in 2014, but since that time the national experience with that therapy has been limited. Our analysis summarises the single-centre experience at the Department of Cardiology and Electrotherapy of the Medical University of Gdansk with the use of S-ICD from the year 2014 to 2017. Methods and results: The S-ICD therapy was used in 12 patients (five male, seven female, mean age 57.2 +/- 12.5 years), in eight of them for the secondary prevention of SCD. No surgical complications of implantation procedures were observed during the perioperative hospitalisation nor during follow-up. During the mean follow-up of 14 +/- 13 months we observed the appropriate function of the systems and a ventricular fibrillation episode successfully terminated by the device in one patient, two cases of S-ICD sensing problems (one of which led to inadequate intervention of the device), and an episode of atrial fibrillation also leading to inadequate intervention in another patient. Conclusions: S-ICD, being an effective and safe method used to treat patients at risk of SCD, may be safely and successfully introduced into clinical practice in centres new to that field. The number of complications during the initial experience and introduction of that method may be kept low if the operating team is experienced enough in cardiac electrotherapy."
415658400003,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,Climate change and political discourse: analysis of energy efficiency and conservation block grants in Dallas-Fort Worth,"Little is known about municipal planning for energy reduction and climate change in conservative areas of the United States, where opposition to environmentalism is often vocal and persistent. This paper analyzes the experience of 31 municipalities in the Dallas-Fort Worth region of Texas implementing the federal energy efficiency and conservation block grant. A qualitative case study approach and extensive interviews with municipal staff yield a detailed description of the political discourse of energy issues and climate change planning. Many municipalities used the grant funds for necessary maintenance projects and had little impact on long-term energy independence or climate change leadership. A subset of municipalities expressed fear of citizen disapproval and some experienced significant opposition that changed or halted their efforts. Based on effective initiatives and common challenges, recommendations are made to foster energy and climate planning in conservative regions and improve implementation of national policies on the local level."
439092200006,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,Impacts of forest structure on precipitation interception and run-off generation in a semiarid region in northern China,"Water resource scarcity and uneven distribution are 2 major environmental issues in China today. Forest structure is a dominant factor that influences hydrological processes, but the specific interactions remain uncertain due to the predominant use of individual or 1-dimensional forest structure metrics in previous studies. In this study, forest structures in 8 run-off plots on Mount Miaofeng in north China were parameterized by metrics of different dimensionalities. The relation between canopy interception and forest structure, shrub/litter interception, and forest structure as well as run-off and forest structure were analysed by regression method and validated by leave-one-out cross test. The results showed that canopy interception rates ranged from less than 0.10 all the way to 0.80, affected by forest structure and precipitation, with interception rate decreasing logarithmically as precipitation increased. Forests with a larger canopy area (CA), leaf area index (LAI), and higher average height (H) had a narrow range of canopy interception rates, and forest with larger value of diameters at breath height (DBH), H, LAI, vertical heterogeneity coefficient (T), and structure complexity index (SCI) had higher interception rates. Forests with higher value of DBH, H, and horizontal heterogeneity coefficient (R) had higher shrub/litter interception rates on the forest floor. The run-off coefficient was only significantly associated with LAI, T, and SCI. The validation test indicated that regression analysis of canopy interception rates and shrub interception are reliable and SCI is a key factor to influence the run-off coefficient. However, the regression results of litter interception have a relatively large error. According to the results, to reduce the risks of the landslides and floods, forest managers should complicate the canopy and preserve trees with thicker stems and larger canopies. By contrast, to obtain more water resource from run-off in arid regions, forest managers should harvest trees with large canopies and construct complex vertical structures by intermediate cutting."
439053800015,HEALTH & PLACE,How extractive industries affect health: Political economy underpinnings and pathways,"A systematic and theoretically informed analysis of how extractive industries affect health outcomes and health inequities is overdue. Informed by the work of Saskia Sassen on ""logics of extraction,"" we adopt an expansive definition of extractive industries to include (for example) large-scale foreign acquisitions of agricultural land for export production. To ground our analysis in concrete place-based evidence, we begin with a brief review of four case examples of major extractive activities. We then analyze the political economy of extractivism, focusing on the societal structures, processes, and relationships of power that drive and enable extraction. Next, we examine how this global order shapes and interacts with politics, institutions, and policies at the state/national level contextualizing extractive activity. Having provided necessary context, we posit a set of pathways that link the global political economy and national politics and institutional practices surrounding extraction to health outcomes and their distribution. These pathways involve both direct health effects, such as toxic work and environmental exposures and assassination of activists, and indirect effects, including sustained impoverishment, water insecurity, and stress-related ailments. We conclude with some reflections on the need for future research on the health and health equity implications of the global extractive order."

We developed a NeuroNICU (neurologic neonatal intensive care unit) to better provide neurologically focused intensive care. Study Design Demographic and clinical variables, services delivered, and patient outcomes were recorded in a prospective database for all neonates admitted to the NeuroNICU between April 23, 2013, and June 25, 2015. Results In total, 546 neonates were admitted to the NeuroNICU representing 32% of all NICU admissions. The most common admission diagnoses were congenital heart disease (30%), extreme prematurity (18%), seizures (10%), and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (9%). Neuromonitoring was common, with near-infrared spectroscopy used in 69%, amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (EEG) in 45%, and continuous video EEG in 35%. Overall, 43% received neurology or neurosurgery consultation. Death prior to hospital discharge occurred in 11%. Among survivors, 87% were referred for developmental follow-up, and among those with a primary neurologic diagnosis 57% were referred for neurology or neurosurgical follow-up. Conclusion The NeuroNICU-admitted newborns with or at risk of brain injury comprise a high percentage of NICU volume; 38% had primary neurologic diagnoses, whereas 62% had medical diagnoses. We found many opportunities to provide brain focused intensive care, impacting a substantial proportion of newborns in our NICU."
426268500084,OPTICS EXPRESS,Proposed liquid-cooled nanowire lasers,"While the nanowire (NW) lasers have attracted much attentions as nanoscale coherent sources in recent years, the heat accumulation and temperature-rise-induced breakdown remain challenges to improving the lasers for practical applications. Here we propose a microscale liquid-cooled approach to address the issue. Calculated results show that, compared with conventional air-cooled lasing systems, liquid-cooled NW lasers can allow much higher thermal power. By keeping the NW temperature below 373 K, the allowed thermal power in water is about 21 times that in air (850 mu W in water versus 40 mu W in air). Transient temperature evolution reveals a much faster heat dissipation of the NW in water (30 ns) than in air (7 mu s), indicating a much higher allowable repetition rate in water than in air (e.g., 10 MHz versus 100 kHz). Our results suggest a possible route to compact NW lasers with higher power, new materials and new operation modes.

Methods: Urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) and albumin-to-protein ratio (uAPR) were measured cross-sectionally after a median of four years of TDF. At this time, alongside extensive laboratory testing, patients underwent evaluation of liver stiffness and blood pressure. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was measured longitudinally before and during TDF therapy. Results: Among 101 participants (66% women, median age 44 years, median CD4 count 572 cells/mm(3)) 21% and 17% had detectable HIV-1 RNA and HBV DNA, respectively. Overall 35% showed hypertension, 6% diabetes, 7% liver stiffness indicative of cirrhosis, and 18% urinary excretion of Schistosoma antigen. Tubular proteinuria occurred in 16% of patients and was independently predicted by female gender and hypertension. The eGFR declined by median 1.8 ml/min/year during TDF exposure (IQR -4.4, -0.0); more pronounced declines (>= 5 ml/min/year) occurred in 22% of patients and were associated with receiving ritonavir-boosted lopinavir rather than efavirenz. HBV DNA, HBeAg, transaminases, and liver stiffness were not predictive of renal function abnormalities. Conclusions: The findings mandate improved diagnosis and management of hypertension and suggest targeted laboratory monitoring of patients receiving TDF alongside a booster in sub-Saharan Africa.

The aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy and safety of Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules in patients with postprandial distress syndrome (PDS)-predominant FD. Methods: The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled design in 197 patients with PDS. All participants received placebo treatment for 1 week. Patients whose total symptom score decreased by <50% after the placebo treatment were recruited into the 4-week treatment period, in which they were randomly assigned to be treated with either Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules or placebo. The patients were then followed for 2 weeks without any treatment. Dyspeptic symptoms were scored at weeks 2 and 4 during the random treatment period and 2 weeks after the treatment. Anxiety and depression symptoms were also scored and compared. Results: (1) The total effective rates in the Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules group at weeks 2 and 4 during the random treatment period and 2 weeks after treatment were all significantly higher than those in the placebo group (38.82% vs. 8.75%, P < 0.001; 69.14% vs. 16.25%, P < 0.001; 77.65% vs. 21.25%, P < 0.001). (2) The total dyspeptic symptoms scores in the Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules group at weeks 2 and 4 and 2 weeks after treatment were significantly lower than those in the placebo group. (3) The severity and frequency of each dyspeptic symptom at weeks 2 and 4 and the follow-up period were all significantly lower than those in the placebo group. (4) The anxiety scores in the Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group. (5) Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules did not have more adverse effects than the placebo. Conclusion: Qi-Zhi-Wei-Tong granules offer significant symptomatic improvement in PDS with no more adverse effects than placebo."

415135500029,APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE,Inhibiting polysulfides diffusion of lithium-sulfur batteries using an acetylene black-CoS2 modified separator: Mechanism research and performance improvement,"Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising chemistries in secondary energy storage field owing to their high energy density. However, the poor electrochemical performance mainly associated with the polysulfides shuttle has greatly hampered their practical application. Herein, a simple acetylene black (AB)-CoS2 coated separator is first designed to suppress the migration of polysulfides. The AB-CoS2 modified separator can not only efficiently capture the polysulfides by forming strong chemical bonding but also guarantee the rapid lithium ions diffusion. Moreover, the AB-CoS2 coating could serve as an upper current collector to accelerate electron transport for reinforcing the utilization of sulfur and ensuring the reactivation of the trapped active material. Consequently, the Li-S cell using AB-CoS2 modified separator shows a long-term cycling stability with an extremely low decay rate (0.09% per cycle) up to 450 cycles at a high rate of 2 C (3350 mA g(-1)). It also exhibits excellent rate capabilities, which maintains a capacity of 475 mAh g(-1) even at 4.0 C rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, several small observational studies have reported no increase in adverse events when hyperthyroid patients undergo thyroidectomy. The aim of this study was to assess outcomes following total thyroidectomy in patients who were biochemically hyperthyroid at the time of surgery compared to those who were euthyroid. One hundred and fifty-one eligible patients undergoing thyroidectomy for hyperthyroidism between January 2012 and February 2016 were identified, of whom 57 were hyperthyroid on perioperative blood tests and 94 were euthyroid (comparison group). Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality, increased length of postoperative hospital stay and intraoperative signs consistent with thyrotoxicosis (e.g. heart rate >100 per minute, systolic blood pressure >180 or <60 mmHg, or temperature >38 degrees C). Secondary outcomes were intraoperative beta-blocker use and level of care required postoperatively. Thirty-day mortality was zero. The only significant difference between the two groups was a higher use of intraoperative beta-blockers amongst hyperthyroid patients (28.1% versus 8.5%, P=0.002). Our findings suggest that thyroidectomy for mild to moderate biochemical hyperthyroidism performed by an experienced thyroid surgeon and anaesthetist, is associated with increased intraoperative beta-blocker use but no statistical difference in mortality, length of postoperative stay or intraoperative signs consistent with thyrotoxicosis. While we still recommend attempting to achieve a euthyroid state whenever possible prior to thyroid surgery, mild to moderate degrees of residual biochemical hyperthyroidism when appropriately managed may not be associated with an increase in adverse outcomes."
437010200006,SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS,LARGE-SCALE HYDROMAGNETIC DYNAMO BY LEHNERT WAVES IN NONRESISTIVE PLASMA,"A new mechanism of large-scale magnetic fields generation is studied, which is based on creation of mean electromotive force through interactions between distinct Lehnert (magneto-Coriolis) waves. The crucial feature of this mechanism is that it does not require magnetic diffusivity to operate, in contrast to the hitherto known standard diffusive one. The hydromagnetic dynamo problem is studied at a fundamental level, with nonstationary spectrum tensor of the underlying turbulence, and the obtained results are discussed in the context of the standard theory of large-scale magnetic field generation. The significance of the new mechanism is found to manifest itself at E-eta << Rm(-3/4) where E-eta is the modified Ekman number based on magnetic diffusivity and Rm >> 1 denotes the magnetic Reynolds number."
435428900034,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW,Space and energy-based turbulent scale-resolving simulations of flow in a 5 x 5 nuclear reactor core fuel assembly with a spacer grid,"The partially averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence model, which is a bridging model between the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes model and direct numerical simulation, is capable of directly resolving the turbulent scales of interest by filtering the Navier-Stokes equation using turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation based filters. In this study, comparison is made between the partially averaged Navier-Stokes and large eddy simulation models, with emphasis on the mean flow characteristics and spatio-temporal turbulent flow structures. The results show that the partially averaged Navier-Stokes modeling produces results comparable to those of large eddy simulation when the appropriate cut-off energy filter is chosen. The test case involves simulating flows in a 5 x 5 fuel rod bundle configuration with a spacer grid at a Reynolds number of 14,000. The simulation results are compared with particle image velocimetry data obtained from the scientific literature.T"
423001900053,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,Revealing hidden CO2 impacts from consequential consumption by matrix analysis: Application to Japanese single households,"The aim of this study was to develop a novel analytical framework using matrix-based analysis, to visualize the environmental impacts of consumption, by considering the direct and indirect consumption of all the items induced by the initial consumption (called ""consequential consumption""), in the context of consequential life cycle assessment (LCA). The significance of this framework and the importance of considering consequential consumption have been demonstrated by analyzing the net CO2 emissions due to consumption, through a case study of single households in Japan. The analytical framework includes the following four steps: (1) categorization of consumers, (2) calculation of a matrix of consequential consumption, (3) impact assessment, and (4) uncertainty analysis. The normalization process plays an essential role in the calculation of a matrix of consequential consumption, while meeting the constraint of fixed income. The matrix of consequential consumption was obtained by analyzing the latest Japanese household expenditure data for 2004. The net CO2 emission from consumption was estimated using the matrix of consequential consumption and the CO2 intensities of products/services in Japan. As a result, we found that the consumption of some products/services have the potential to increase/decrease CO2 emissions beyond their own CO2 intensities, because of consequential consumption. In spite of their relatively small CO2 intensities, several products and services (meat, dairy products and eggs, oils, fats and condiments, water and sewerage charges, domestic nondurable goods) have high net CO2 emissions per unit price (Japanese yen; JPY). This is because of high CO2 emissions from the consequential consumption of energy. In contrast, the net CO2 emission from charges for board are negative because of the substitution relationship between food and energy items. Compared with the results of other foregoing studies on food materials, the net CO2 emission by our approach is much larger than that indicated by the conventional process-specific approach.

448315700014,PSYCHOTHERAPY,A Meta-Analysis of the Association Between Patients' Early Perception of Treatment Credibility and Their Posttreatment Outcomes,"Patients' perception of treatment credibility represents their belief about a treatment's personal logicality, suitability, and efficaciousness. Although long considered an important common factor bearing on clinical outcome, there have been no systematic reviews of the credibility-outcome association. The present study represents a meta-analysis of the association between patients' credibility perception and their posttreatment outcomes. To be included, articles published through August. 2017 had to (a) include a clinical sample. (b) include a therapist-delivered treatment of at least 3 sessions. (c) include a measure of patients' own early treatment credibility perception, (d) include at least 1 posttreatment mental health outcome not explicitly referenced as a follow-up occasion, and (e) report a statistical test of the credibility-outcome association. The meta-analysis was conducted on 24 independent samples (extracted from 19 references) with 1,504 patients. The overall weighted effect size was r = .12, p < .001, or d = .24. with high heterogeneity (I-2 = 57%) and no evidence of publication bias. There were no significant moderating effects on the credibility-outcome association for any of the potential moderators that we evaluated. The meta-analytic findings are discussed in light of methodological limitations and with regard to their practice implications."
429345300001,MARINE RESOURCE ECONOMICS,Estimating Lost Recreational Use Values of Visitors to Northwest Florida due to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Using Cancelled Trip Data,"The lost recreational use values from the BP/Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico were estimated from cancelled recreational trips to Northwest Florida. The impacts were calculated using the travel cost method for a single site with primary data collected from an online survey conducted after the spill. The data were collected in August and September 2011 with respondents residing in 13 US states that constitute the primary domestic market for coastal tourism to Northwest Florida. The survey gathered information from respondents on their recreational visits, including detailed information on their past trips and the number of trips cancelled to the study region due to the oil spill. The empirical analysis involves the estimation of a random parameter negative binomial count data demand model. Using this model we find significant preference heterogeneity surrounding the effects of the oil spill. Aggregate damages are estimated to be $207 million."
423895600006,PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,Effects of Rhizophagus clarus and P availability in the tolerance and physiological response of Mucuna cinereum to copper,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) improve plant ability to uptake P and tolerate heavy metals. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of available P and the inoculation of Rhizophagus clarus in a Cu-contaminated soil (i) on the activity of acid phosphatases (soil and plant), the presence of glomalin, and (ii) in the biochemical and physiological status of Mucuna cinereum. A Typic Hapludalf soil artificially contaminated by adding 60 mg kg(-1) Cu was used in a 3 x 2 factorial design with three replicates. Treatments consisted of three P levels: 0, 40, and 100 mg kg(-1) P. Each P treatment level was inoculated ( + AMF)/non-inoculated (-AMF) with 200 spores of R. claws per pot, and plants grown for 45 days. The addition of at least 40 mg kg(-1) P and the inoculation of plants with R. clarus proved to be efficient to reduce Cu phytotoxicity and increase dry matter yield. Mycorrhization and phosphate fertilization reduced the activity of enzymes regulating oxidative stress (SOD and POD), and altered the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, due to the lower stress caused by available Cu. These results suggest a synergism between the application of P and the inoculation with R. clarus, favoring the growth of M. cinereum in a Cu-contaminated soil. This study shows that AMF inoculation represents an interesting alternative to P fertilization to improve plant development when exposed to excess Cu."
455631600020,JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS,Remaining lifetime prediction for nonlinear degradation device with random effect,"For the large number of nonlinear degradation devices existing in a project, the existing methods have not systematically studied the effects of random effect on the remaining lifetime (RL), the accuracy and efficiency of the parameters estimation are not high, and the current degradation state of the target device is not accurately estimated. In this paper, a nonlinear Wiener degradation model with random effect is proposed and the corresponding probability density function (PDF) of the first hitting time (FHT) is deduced. A parameter estimation method based on modified expectation maximum (EM) algorithm is proposed to obtain the estimated value of fixed coefficient and the priori value of random coefficient in the model. The posterior value of the random coefficient and the current degradation state of target device are updated synchronously by the state space model (SSM) and the Kalman filter algorithm. The PDF of RL with random effect is deduced. A simulation example is analyzed to verify that the proposed method has the obvious advantage over the existing methods in parameter estimation error and RL prediction accuracy."
449943500076,ANTICANCER RESEARCH,Prognostic Factors for Pancreatic Cancer Patients Treated with Immune-cell Therapy,"Background/Aim: The past 17 years, immune-cell therapy has been administered to 990 patients with advanced or recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 50 patients with curatively resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods: The correlation between overall survival (OS) and various factors including sex, age, performance status (PS), distant metastasis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and type of immune-cell therapy were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The median OS of advanced or recurrent pancreatic cancer was 5.8 months, and the prognosis was improved in pancreatic cancer patients who received immune-cell therapy with PS scores of 0-1 [hazard risk (HR)=0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.46-0.68; p<0.0001], chemotherapy (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.54-0.87; p=0.002), or radiotherapy (HR=0.76; 95% CI=0.63-0.93; p=0.006). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that distant metastasis indicated a poor prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients that were administered immune-cell therapy (HR=1.62; 95% CI=1.37-1.93; p<0.0001). Additionally, the combined immune-cell therapy with alpha beta T cell and dendritic cell (DC) vaccine provided a survival benefit in advanced or recurrent pancreatic cancer patients (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.57-0.83; p<0.0001). Conclusion: A survival benefit could be potentially obtained with better PS by the combination of alpha beta T cell therapy, DC vaccine therapy, and chemotherapy at an early stage in pancreatic cancer."
452307100006,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH,Association between skin lesion and arsenic concentration in hair by mixed bivariate model in chronic arsenic exposure,"Skin lesion is one of the important health hazards caused by high intake of arsenic through drinking water and diet, and the other hazards include several types of cancers (viz. skin, lung and urinary bladder), ischemic heart disease, hypertension, etc. Two most important biomarkers to measure arsenic intake in a human body are arsenic concentration in urine and hair. The primary interest of this paper is the association between skin lesion and arsenic concentration in hair for participants with chronic arsenic exposure from West Bengal, India, using bivariate regression model based on copula function. The result showed participants with high arsenic concentration in hair had higher incidence of developing skin lesion. Arsenic concentration in hair was significantly higher for the participants with an arsenic concentration in water > 10 mg/L."
448378800012,JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES,Cross-Country Comparisons of Disability and Morbidity: Evidence from the Gateway to Global Aging Data,"Background: International comparisons of disease prevalence have been useful in understanding what proportion of disease might be preventable and in informing potential policy interventions in different cultural and economic contexts. Using newly available, harmonized data from 20 countries, we compare disability and morbidity of older adults between the ages of 55 and 74. Methods: The Gateway to Global Aging Data, a data and information portal, provides access to easy-to-use individual-level longitudinal data from 10 surveys covering over 30 countries. Exploiting harmonized measures available from the Gateway, we descriptively examine how disability and morbidity differ across countries. Results: Significant cross-country differences are observed for several health indicators. Comparing countries with the highest and lowest prevalence rates, we observe that hypertension rates vary twofold and stroke rates vary threefold, while disability and arthritis rates vary more than fivefold. Among women, higher gross domestic product and life expectancy are related to lower diabetes, heart disease, and better functioning. Among men, national indicators of economic conditions are not significantly associated with reported disease prevalence. Conclusions: We document substantial heterogeneity in disability and morbidity across countries, separately for men and women and after controlling for population age composition and education. Rich data from various surveys across the world offers remarkable opportunities for cross-country analyses, calling for further investigation of what drives observed differences. The Gateway to Global Aging Data provides easy-to-use harmonized data files and tools to facilitate this type of research."
432040700016,MEDICAL ONCOLOGY,"""Give me five"" ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: non-invasive ablative approach","Ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) is given over a shorter time with larger doses with respect to conventional fractionation in patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa). The use of hypofractionation is supported both from the radiobiological point of view (the low alpha/beta-ratio in PCa and dose escalation) and from the rising number of clinical evidences. The aim of this study is to review our data regarding oncological outcomes, namely biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) and clinical progression-free survival (c-PFS), acute and long-term toxicities in patients treated with a ultra-hypofractionated RT. A series of 194 patients with clinically localized PCa treated primarily with ultra-hypofractionated RT using image-guided intensity modulated RT (IG-IMRT) at our Institute from 2012 to 2015 was included in this analysis. According to NCCN risk group classification, 65 (33.5%) patients were low risk, 101 (52.1%) intermediate risk, and 28 (14.4%) high risk. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was given to 61 patients (31.4%). A 169 patients (87.1%) received 35 Gy in 5 fractions, while 25 patients (13%) received 32.5 Gy in 5 fractions (usually given in patients with comorbidity). The median duration of the treatment was 10 days (IQR 9-12). Biochemical relapse was defined as a rise of prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 2 ng/ml above nadir. b-PFS, c-PFS, and freedom from gastro-intestinal (GI) and genito-urinary (GU) toxicity curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test and multivariate Cox models were used to investigate the role RT dose and heterogeneity by NCCN risk groups adjusting for prognostic factors. Data on acute and late term toxicities were collected according to RTOG/EORTC grading system. With a median follow-up of 30 months, 17 patients experienced PSA failure (9%). The 3-year b-PFS was 87% for all patients and rates stratified for the NCCN risk were 94, 82, and 66% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Log-rank tests indicate that biochemical progression was significantly greater for patients with initial PSA (iPSA) greater than 7 ng/ml (P = 0.04), high- and intermediate-risk groups (P = 0.002), low total dose (P = 0.02) and Gleason score (GS) equal or greater than 7 (P = 0.04). No statistically significant association was found with T stage nor ADT. In multivariate analyses, total dose (P = 0.03) and risk groups (P = 0.03) remained significantly associated with recurrence. Acute and late GI and GU toxicity were acceptable. The toxicity of ultra-hypofractionated IG-IMRT in a large clinical cohort of PCa patients was tolerable and confirmed that this treatment is safe and offers excellent tumor control. Moreover, the hypofractionated RT allows to deliver the whole RT over 10 days with a sensible impact in patients' quality of life and potential overall health system and social benefits."
427472500006,FEBS LETTERS,"Evidence for a hierarchical transcriptional circuit in Drosophila male germline involving testis-specific TAF and two gene-specific transcription factors, Mod and Acj6","To analyze transcription factors involved in gene regulation by testis-specific TAF (tTAF), tTAF-dependent promoters were mapped and analyzed in silico. Core promoters show decreased AT content, paucity of classical promoter motifs, and enrichment with translation control element CAAAATTY. Scanning of putative regulatory regions for known position frequency matrices identified 19 transcription regulators possibly contributing to tTAF-driven gene expression. Decreased male fertility associated with mutation in one of the regulators, Acj6, indicates its involvement in male reproduction. Transcriptome study of testes from male mutants for tTAF, Acj6, and previously characterized tTAF-interacting factor Modulo implies the existence of a regulatory hierarchy of tTAF, Modulo and Acj6, in which Modulo and/or Acj6 regulate one-third of tTAF-dependent genes."
436857400001,FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA,Structure of parasite communities in urban environments: the case of helminths in synanthropic rodents,"Identifying patterns with sufficient predictive power is a constant challenge for ecologists to address ecological problems related to species conservation, pollution or infectious disease control. During the last years, the amounts of parasitological studies in this sense increased, but they are still scarce in urban environments. The main aim of this study was to investigate if the helminth communities of urban rodents are structured within host assembly (compound community) or they are a result of random events occurring at each individual host scale (infracommunity). A total of 203 rodents belonging to four species, Rattus rattus (Linnaeus), Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout), Mus musculus Linnaeus and the native Oligoryzomys flavescens (Waterhouse) and captured in different landscape units of the City of Buenos Aires (industrial- residential neighbourhoods, shantytowns and parklands) were analysed. The results showed that infracommunities could be grouped according to composition and relative abundances and that they respond to the structure of the host community. Thus, the component communities defined in this study could be identified as subsets of the compound community (rodent assemblage) and infracommunities (each host) as random samples within each one. Quantitative differences among component communities were denoted by comparing the infection levels of helminths described as central species. Therefore, infracommunities of R. norvegicus and O. flavescens were the most predictable because of the high abundance of the nematodes Heterakis spumosa Schneider, 1866 and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Travassos, 1914), and Stilestrongylus flavescens (Sutton et Durette-Desset, 1991), respectively. Several mechanisms contribute to complexity of the structure of parasite communities, where specific parasites, definitive and intermediate hosts, and environmental and anthropogenic factors all play a role in the dynamics of the compound community."
453388000025,RHEUMATOLOGY,Inhibition of CCL3 abrogated precursor cell fusion and bone erosions in human osteoclast cultures and murine collagen-induced arthritis,"Objective. Macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (CCL3) is a chemokine that regulates macrophage trafficking to the inflamed joint. The agonistic effect of CCL3 on osteolytic lesions in patients with multiple myeloma is recognized; however, its role in skeletal damage during inflammatory arthritis has not been established. The aim of the study was to explore the role of osteoclast-associated CCL3 upon bone resorption, and to test its pharmacological blockade for protecting against bone pathology during inflammatory arthritis. Methods. CCL3 production was studied during osteoclast differentiation from osteoclast precursor cells: human CD14-positive mononuclear cells. Mice with CIA were treated with an anti-CCL3 antibody. The effect of CCL3 blockade through mAb was studied through osteoclast number, cytokine production and bone resorption on ivory disks, and in vivo through CIA progression (clinical score, paw diameter, synovial inflammation and bone damage). Results. Over time, CCL3 increased in parallel with the number of osteoclasts in culture. Anti-CCL3 treatment achieved a concentration-dependent inhibition of osteoclast fusion and reduced pit formation on ivory disks (P <= 0.05). In CIA, anti-CCL3 treatment reduced joint damage and significantly decreased multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts and erosions in the wrists (P < 0.05) and elbows (P < 0.05), while also reducing joint erosions in the hind (P < 0.01) and fore paws (P < 0.01) as confirmed by X-ray. Conclusion. Inhibition of osteoclast-associated CCL3 reduced osteoclast formation and function whilst attenuating arthritis-associated bone loss and controlling development of erosion in murine joints, thus uncoupling bone damage from inflammation. Our findings may help future innovations for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory arthritis."
448521600001,EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,Xingnao Jieyu Decoction Ameliorates Poststroke Depression through the BDNF/ERK/CREB Pathway in Rats,"Background. The neurotrophic pathway regulated by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of poststrake depression (PSD). How the traditional Chinese medicine compound preparation Xingnao Jieyu (XNJY) decoction regulates the neurotrophic pathway to treat PSD is unclear. Objective. This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of XNJY decoction on a rat model of PSD and the molecular mechanism intervening in the neurotrophic pathway. Methods. After a middle cerebral artery occlusion model was established, chronic unpredictable mild stress was applied for 21 days to prepare a PSD model. XNJY groups and a fluoxetine (Flu) group of rats were intragastrically administered with XNJY and Flu, respectively, for 21 consecutive days. Depressive-like behaviors, including sucrose preference, open field test, and forced swimming test, were assessed. The survival and apoptosis of cortical and hippocampal neurons were evaluated by immunofluorescence assay and TUNEL staining. 'I he contents of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and BI)NF in the cortex and hippocampus were determined by ELISA. The protein levels of BDNF, p-ERK/ERK, and p-CREB/CREB in the cortical and hippocampal regions were tested by Western blot. Results. The depressive-like behaviors markedly unproved after XNJY and Flu treatment. XNJY and Flu promoted neuronal survival and protected cortical and hippocampal neurons from apoptosis. XNJY also increased the contents of 5-HT, NE, and BDNF and recovered the protein levels of p-ERK/ERK, p-CREB/CREB, and BDNF in the cortical and hippocampal regions. Conclusion. These results indicated that the XNJY decoction exerts an obvious antidepressant effect, which may be due to the regulation of the BDNF/ERK/CREB signaling pathway."
440531100004,STANFORD LAW REVIEW,The Challenge of the New Preemption,"The past decade has witnessed the emergence and rapid spread of a new and aggressive form of state preemption of local government action across a wide range of subjects, including among others firearms, workplace conditions, sanctuary cities, antidiscrimination laws, and environmental and public health regulation. Particularly striking are punitive measures that do not just preempt local measures but also hit local officials or governments with criminal or civil fines, state aid cutoffs, or liability for damages, as well as broad preemption proposals that would virtually end local initiative over a wide range of subjects. The rise of the new preemption is closely linked to the partisan and ideological polarization between red states and their blue cities. This Essay examines the spread of the new preemption and explores the legal doctrines available to local governments for challenging it. It argues that the more extreme preemption measures threaten the capacity for local self-government and are at odds with the values of local autonomy, the cornerstone role local governments play in our governmental structure, and the widespread state constitutional commitment to home rule. It also considers whether arguments about localism, like arguments about federalism, are really just about means to specific policy ends. It concludes that particularly in the current era of polarization, our system ought to protect some local space for self-determination for problems that arise at the local level."

417304500055,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL,Biogas-based polyhydroxyalkanoates production by Methylocystis hirsuta: A step further in anaerobic digestion biorefineries,"The potential of biogas (with and without H2S) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) to support microbial growth and accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) in type II methanotrophs was evaluated batchwise under aerobic conditions. Methylocystis hirsuta was able to grow on artificial biogas (70% CH4, 29.5% CO2, 0.5% H2S) and accumulate PHA up to 45 +/- 1% (wt.%) under N-limited conditions. The presence of CO2 and H2S did not significantly influence the growth and PHA synthesis in M. hirsuta compared to control tests provided with pure CH4 at similar concentrations. Likewise, the addition of VFAs to the cultivation broth at initial concentrations of 100-200 mg L-1 did not hamper the growth of this strain on artificial biogas. Indeed, the addition of 10% extra carbon in the form of individual VFAs resulted in an increase in the maximum PHA yield and final PHA content up to 0.45-0.63 gPHA gSubstrate(1) and 48-54% (wt.%), respectively, at the expense of a higher energy demand. Valeric acid supplementation supported the highest 3-hydroxyvalerate content (13.5%) within the biocomposite. In this context, this study demonstrated for the first time that 3-hydroxyvalerate synthesis by M. hirsuta did not depend on CH4 assimilation."
427195600040,CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY,The Psychometric Validity and Reliability of the Turkish Version of the Existential Loneliness Questionnaire,"Loneliness is accepted as a universal concept but it is still controversial in terms of its source and nature. Existential loneliness, a primary and inevitable condition of human existence as the only certain thing is death, was described as intolerable emptiness, sadness, and longing due to the awareness of one's fundemental separtenes as a human being. The Existential Loneliness Questionnaire (ELQ) was particularly developed to assess existential loneliness. The objective of the current study was to examine psychometric reliability and validity of the ELQ in Turkish samples. As a result of exploratory factor analysis, two items were deleted, and the remaining 20 items formed the three factors of ELQ, loneliness in social ties, loneliness in close relationships, and finding meaning in life. Twenty-item Turkish ELQ appeared to be a reliable and valid measure of existential loneliness. The 3-factor structure of ELQ obtained through principle component analysis was also partially supported by multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) indicating that ELQ is an aggregate measure. Further research with a larger community sample is needed in order to demonstrate the generalizability of the current findings to other samples."

448407100010,BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER,Colon-specific eQTL analysis to inform on functional SNPs,"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies on colorectal cancer have identified more than 60 susceptibility loci, but for most of them there is no clear knowledge of functionality or the underlying gene responsible for the risk modification. Expression quantitative trail loci (eQTL) may provide functional information for such single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). METHODS: We have performed detailed eQTL analysis specific for colon tissue on a series of 97 colon tumours, their paired adjacent normal mucosa and 47 colon mucosa samples donated by healthy individuals. R package MatrixEQTL was used to search for genome-wide cis-eQTL and trans-eQTL fitting linear models adjusted for age, gender and tissue type to rank transformed expression data. RESULTS: The cis-eQTL analyses has revealed 29,073 SNP-gene associations with permutation-adjusted P-values <0.01. These correspond to 363 unique genes. The trans-eQTL analysis identified 10,665 significant SNP-gene associations, most of them in the same chromosome, further than 1 Mb of the gene. We provide a web tool to search for specific SNPs or genes. The tool calculates Pearson or Spearman correlation, and allows to select tissue type for analysis. Data and plots can be exported. CONCLUSIONS: This resource should be useful to prioritise SNPs for further functional studies and to identify relevant genes behind identified loci."
429969700006,IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY,Suppression of Punch-Through Current in 3 kV 4H-SiC Reverse-Blocking MOSFET by Using Highly Doped Drift Layer,"Low on-resistance 4H-SiC reverse-blocking (RB) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) have been developed by adopting a non-punch-through (NPT) drift layer in order to suppress the punch-through ( PT) current under the reverse-blocking condition. The n-type NPT drift layer was 40-mu m thick doped to 3.7 x 10(15) cm(-3). The forward and reverse breakdown voltages of the fabricated NPT RB MOSFET were 3.6 kV and -3.0 kV, respectively. The differential specific on-resistance was 13.5 m Omega.cm(2) at room temperature, which was 33% lower than that of a 3 kV PT RB MOSFET, demonstrating superiority of the developed NPT RB MOSFET as a high-performance bidirectional switch."
439528400076,ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,Solution-Phase Synthesis of Platinum Nanoparticle-Decorated Metal-Organic Framework Hybrid Nanomaterials as Biomimetic Nanoenzymes for Biosensing Applications,"The synthesis of nanomaterials with specific properties and functions as biomimetic nanoenzymes has attracted extensive attention in the past decades due to their great potential to substitute natural enzymes. Herein, a facile and simple method for the preparation of platinum nanoparticle (PtNP)-decorated two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites was developed. A ligand with heme-like structure, Fe(III) tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphine chloride (TCPP(Fe)), was applied to synthesize MOF nanosheets (denoted as Cu-TCPP(Fe) nanosheets) in high yield. Ultrathin Cu-TCPP(Fe) nanosheets with thickness less than 10 nm were used as a novel template for the growth of ultrasmall and uniform PtNPs. Significantly, the obtained hybrid nanomaterials (PtNPs/Cu-TCPP(Fe) hybrid nanosheets) exhibit enhanced peroxidase-like activity compared to PtNPs, Cu-TCPP(Fe) nanosheets, and the physical mixture of both due to the synergistic effect. On account of the excellent peroxidase-like activity of PtNPs/Cu-TCPP(Fe) hybrid nanosheets, we established a colorimetric method for sensitive and rapid detection of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, by combining with glucose oxidase, a cascade colorimetric method was established to further detect glucose with excellent sensitivity and selectivity."

Sprays of 180 mg L-1 GA(3) and 180 mg L-1 AVG were applied, combined and isolated, at 34, 40, and 44 days after anthesis (DAA), and peduncles were harvested ripe at 46 DAA and evaluated for physical and physiological variables. The treatment with GA(3) resulted in firmer peduncles with a greater apical diameter, but did not affect the physiological variables activity of the pectin methylesterase and polygalacturonase cell wall enzymes and degree of lipid peroxidation of the biological membranes, nor the physical attributes total mass (peduncles and nut) and nut size. At early developmental stages (34 DAA), GA(3) increased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, and, at later stages (40 DAA), promoted polyphenol and carotenoid accumulation. The application of AVG at the final stages (44 DAA) provided greater total antioxidant activity, despite the lower ascothate peroxidase activity. The application of GA(3) pre-harvest increases the firmness and diameter of the cashew peduncles, and the treatment with AVG increases the total antioxidant activity of the peduncles."
439421600027,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Challenges and Opportunities for Emergency Department Sepsis Screening at Triage,"Feasibility of ED triage sepsis screening, before diagnostic testing has been performed, has not been established. In a retrospective, outcome-blinded chart review of a one-year cohort of ED adult septic shock patients (""derivation cohort"") and three additional, non-consecutive months of all adult ED visits (""validation cohort""), we evaluated the qSOFA score, the Shock Precautions on Triage (SPoT) vital-signs criterion, and a triage concern-for-infection (tCFI) criterion based on risk factors and symptoms, to screen for sepsis. There were 19,670 ED patients in the validation cohort; 50 developed ED septic shock, of whom 60% presented without triage hypotension, and 56% presented with non-specific symptoms. The tCFI criterion improved specificity without substantial reduction of sensitivity. At triage, sepsis screens (positive qSOFA vital-signs and tCFI, or positive SPoT vital-signs and tCFI) were 28% (95% CI: 16-43%) and 56% (95% CI: 41-70%) sensitive, respectively, p < 0.01. By the conclusion of the ED stay, sensitivities were 80% (95% CI: 66-90%) and 90% (95% CI: 78-97%), p > 0.05, and specificities were 97% (95% CI: 96-97%) and 95% (95% CI: 95-96%), p < 0.001. ED patients who developed septic shock requiring vasopressors often presented normotensive with non-specific complaints, necessitating a low threshold for clinical concern-for-infection at triage."
447497500001,FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY,"The Effect of Hypoxia and Metformin on Fatty Acid Uptake, Storage, and Oxidation in L6 Differentiated Myotubes","Metabolic impairments associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) are linked to tissue hypoxia, however, the explanatory molecular and endocrine mechanisms remain unknown. Using gas-permeable cultureware, we studied the chronic effects of mild and severe hypoxia on free fatty acid (FFA) uptake, storage, and oxidation in L6 myotubes under 20, 4, or 1% O2. Additionally, the impact of metformin and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) b / d agonist, called GW501516, were investigated. Exposure to mild and severe hypoxia reduced FFA uptake by 37 and 32%, respectively, while metformin treatment increased FFA uptake by 39% under mild hypoxia. GW501516 reduced FFA uptake under all conditions. Protein expressions of CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) and SCL27A4 (solute carrier family 27 fatty acid transporter, member 4) were reduced by 17 and 23% under severe hypoxia. Gene expression of UCP2 (uncoupling protein 2) was reduced by severe hypoxia by 81%. Metformin increased CD36 protein levels by 28% under control conditions and SCL27A4 levels by 56% under mild hypoxia. Intracellular lipids were reduced by mild hypoxia by 18%, while in controls only, metformin administration further reduced intracellular lipids (20% O2) by 36%. Finally, palmitate oxidation was reduced by severe hypoxia, while metformin treatment reduced non-mitochondrial O2 consumption, palmitate oxidation, and proton leak at all O2 levels. Hypoxia directly reduced FFA uptake and intracellular lipids uptake in myotubes, at least partially, due to the reduction in CD36 transporters. Metformin, but not GW501516, can increase FFA uptake and SCL27A4 expression under mild hypoxia. Described effects might contribute to elevated plasma FFA levels and metabolic derangements in OSA."
442424500001,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A,Asymmetric regularization of the ground and excited state of the He-4 nucleus,"We find the threshold structure of the two-and three-nucleon systems, with the deuteron and H-3/He-3 as the only bound nuclei, sufficient to predict a pair of four-nucleon states: a deeply bound state which is identified with the alpha ground state, and a shallow, unstable state at an energy B*(alpha) = [0.38 +/- 0.25] MeV above the triton-proton threshold which is consistent with data on the first excited state of the a. The analysis employs the framework of Pionless EFT at leading order with a generalized regulator prescription which probes renormalization-group invariance of the two states with respect to higher-order perturbations including asymmetrical disturbances of the short-distance structure of the interaction. In addition to this invariance of the bound-state spectrum and the diagonal H-3-p(1)S(0) phase shifts in the alpha channel with respect to the short-distance structure of the nuclear interaction, our multichannel calculations with a resonating-group method demonstrate the increasing sensitivity of nuclei to the neutron-proton P-wave interaction. We show that two-nucleon phase shifts, the triton channel, and three-nucleon negative-parity channels are less sensitive with respect to enhanced two-nucleon P-wave attraction than the four-nucleon H-3-p(1)S(0) phase shifts."
433176000002,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,Metabolic Responses to Low Temperature of Three Peach Fruit Cultivars Differently Sensitive to Cold Storage,"Refrigerated storage is widely applied in order to maintain peach quality but it can also induce chilling injuries (CIs) such as flesh browning and bleeding, and mealiness. Peach fruit from three cultivars (`Red Haven', RH, 'Regina di Londa', RL, and `Flaminia', FL) were stored for 4 weeks under low temperatures (0.5 and 5.5 degrees C). GC-MS was employed to study changes in both metabolome and volatilome induced by cold storage in the mesocarp. CIs were assessed both at the end of each week of storage and after subsequent shelf-life (SL) at 20 degrees C. Flesh browning and meatiness appeared to be more related to 5.5 degrees C storage, while flesh bleeding revealed high incidence following 0.5 degrees C storage. Compared to RL and FL, RH showed a marked lower incidence of CIs. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that RH peaches indeed differ from RL and FL in particular when considering data from samples collected at the end of the cold storage. Common and divergent responses have been identified in terms of metabolic responses to the applied low temperatures. In all three cultivars raffinose, glucose-6P, fucose, xylose, sorbitol, GABA, epicatechin, catechin, and putrescine markedly increased during cold storage, while citramalic, glucuronic, mucic and shikimic acids decreased. Among volatile organic compounds (VOCs), aldehydes and alcohols generally accumulated more under low temperature conditions while esters and lactones evolved during subsequent SL. The main cultivar differences developed after cold storage during SL although some common responses (e.g., an increased production of ethyl acetate) were observed. The lower levels of flesh browning and bleeding displayed by RH peaches were related to compounds with antioxidant activity, or acting as osmotic protectants and membrane stabilizer. Indeed, RH showed higher levels of amino acids and urea, together with a marked increase in putrescine, sorbitol, maltitol, myoinositol and sucrose detected during storage and SL."
424503200002,PHYSICAL REVIEW C,Ab initio calculations of Gamow-Teller strengths in the sd shell,"In the present work we perform a systematic shell-model study of Gamow-Teller transition-strength distributions in sd shell nuclei using ab initio effective interactions. The ab initio effective interactions are based on in-medium similarity renormalization-group and coupled-cluster effective interaction approaches. The aim of the present work is to test the predictive power of ab initio effective interactions by using the available experimental data of Gamow-Teller strength distributions in sd shell nuclei. We perform calculations for Ne-20 -> F-20, Na-23 -> Mg-23, Na-23 -> Ne-23, Mg-24 -> Na-24, Mg-24 -> Al-24, Mg-25 -> Al-25, Mg-26 -> Na-26, Mg-26 -> Al-26, Si-26 -> Al-26, Al-27 -> Si-27, Si-28 -> P-28, P-31 -> Si-31, and S-32 -> P-32 transitions. For comparison we also show the results obtained by using the phenomenological USDB Hamiltonian. The phenomenological USDB results of the Gamow-Teller (GT(+) and GT-) strength distributions show reasonable agreements with the experimental data in comparison with the ab initio interactions. We also calculate the electron-capture reaction rates for Na-23(e-, nu) Ne-23 and Mg-25(e-, nu) Na-25 using ab initio and USDB interactions."
450138200001,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,Responsiveness of Physical Rehabilitation Centers in Capital of Iran: Disparities and Related Determinants in Public and Private Sectors,"Background: Responsiveness as a non-medical, non-financial goal of the health system is of special importance to people with physical disability. The current study assessed the experiences of people with physical disabilities when they encounter rehabilitation centers in Tehran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The sample consisted of 610 people with physical disabilities referred to 10 comprehensive rehabilitation centers (CRCs) selected by Quota sampling. Data were collected by a standard responsiveness questionnaire proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and were analyzed by a standard protocol. Blinder-Oaxaca analysis was done to explain the inequality in performance of public and private sectors. Results: Study participants included 298 (48.7%) women and 312 (51.3%) men. The mean age of the respondents was 46.3 (SD = 14.3) for women and 45.6 (SD = 15.4) for men. Prompt attention (33.3%) and confidentiality (1.3%) were the most and least important reported domains, respectively. Overall poor responsiveness was reported by 20.9% of respondents. Private rehabilitation centers showed significantly better performance in communication, basic amenities and autonomy compared to public centers (P < 0.05). Perceived social class explained 76% of the inequality in autonomy in the private and public sector (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Improving overall responsiveness in domains that are of high importance from the respondents' viewpoint but are performing poorly-areas such as prompt attention and basic amenities-is essential. Additionally, interventions are needed to improve the performance of the public centers and providers in the areas of participation of service users in all social classes in their rehabilitation decisions and procedures, clear communication, and basic amenities."
419130900006,COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY,Do Memory B Cells Form Secondary Germinal Centers? It Depends,"The memory B-cell pool in an immune individual is more heterogeneous than previously recognized. The different types of memory B cells likely play distinct roles in tuning the secondary immune response because they differ in their potential to generate plasmablasts, which secrete antibodies, or germinal center (GC) cells, which generate new and higher affinity memory cells. We propose that the production of plasmablasts or GC cells by a memory B cell is controlled by its state of differentiation and the amount and affinity of antigen-specific antibodies present in the individual in which it resides."
433147700016,POLYMER,Chain terminal group leads to distinct thermoresponsive behaviors of linear PNIPAM and polymer analogs,"Poly(alkylacrylamides), most notably poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), are widely studied thermoresponsive polymers. Linear PNIPAM, poly(N-n-propylacrylamide) (PNnPAM) and poly(N-cyclopropylacrylamide) (PNCPAM) were synthesized via RAFT polymerization to obtain polymers with low dispersity and varying terminal groups. The polymers were studied with a combination of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), turbidimetry measurements, and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations to determine the influence of terminal group and monomer structure on assembly and thermoresponsive behavior in solution. Large scale, fractal assemblies (larger than 1 mu m) are observed below the critical temperature for polymers terminated with short hydrophobic groups, but for long hydrophobic terminal groups, polymers formed small micelles (ca. 15 nm). The two cases give rise to two distinct thermoresponsive behaviors: the fractal assemblies display the traditional coil-to-globule behavior, whereas the corona of the micelles collapsed well below the critical temperature due to n-clustering, while the micelles remained in solution. The results indicate that, despite making up only a small fraction of the polymer, the terminal groups play a large role in both the conformation and assembly of PNIPAM and its analogs below the critical temperature, and hints at the possibility of new design strategies for thermoresponsive materials.

The effects of graphene additive on the surface morphology, phase composition and chemical composition of the PEO coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, the effect of the graphene additive on the mechanical property of the PEO coating was evaluated using micro-hardness tester. Furthermore, the corrosion resistance of the coatings was tested by the potentiodynamic polarization curves and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the graphene was successfully added into the PEO coating, and the incorporation of graphene reduced the number and size of micro-pores and cracks in the coating. Compared with the AZ91 Mg substrate, the micro-hardness of the PEO coating increased more than 15 times, and the corrosion current density decreased about three orders of magnitude when the amount of graphene addition in the electrolyte was 250 mg/L."
447799800020,KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL,Renal transplant recipients receiving loop diuretic therapy have increased urinary tract infection rate and altered medullary macrophage polarization marker expression,"Loop diuretics deplete the renal cortico-medullary salt gradient that has recently been established as a major modulator of immune responses. Renal transplant recipients suffer from a markedly increased rate of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Whether diuretic therapy affects renal macrophage polarization in the human kidney graft and the incidence of UTI have not been reported. In a cohort of 112 adult renal allograft recipients, loop diuretic therapy significantly correlated with the rate of UTI during five years after transplantation in uni-and multivariable regression analysis. The M1 macrophage marker human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and the M2 macrophage marker CD206 co-localized with the pan-macrophage marker CD68 in the kidney graft. Both were more common in renal medulla than cortex. With increasing loop diuretic dose, the renal medullary M1/M2 macrophage marker ratio decreased in early surveillance biopsies of this cohort. In vitro, the sodium chloride concentration dose-dependently increased monocyte chemotactic cytokine CCL2 production in human myeloid and renal tubular epithelial cells. More CCL2 was detected in the renal medulla than cortex of the kidney grafts. However, in patients receiving loop diuretic therapy, the renal cortico-medullary CCL2 gradient was diminished and CCL2 serum levels decreased significantly. Thus, diuretic therapy associated with increased bacteriuria and leukocyturia after kidney transplantation and a decreased M1/M2 macrophage marker ratio in the renal medulla. Hence, adjustment of diuretic therapy should be investigated further as a possible approach in patients with frequent UTIs."
447622800001,NATURE REVIEWS DISEASE PRIMERS,Abdominal aortic aneurysms,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the infrarenal aorta. AAA is a multifactorial disease, and genetic and environmental factors play a part; smoking, male sex and a positive family history are the most important risk factors, and AAA is most common in men >65 years of age. AAA results from changes in the aortic wall structure, including thinning of the media and adventitia due to the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and degradation of the extracellular matrix. If the mechanical stress of the blood pressure acting on the wall exceeds the wall strength, the AAA ruptures, causing life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage - the mortality for patients with ruptured AAA is 65-85%. Although AAAs of any size can rupture, the risk of rupture increases with diameter. Intact AAAs are typically asymptomatic, and in settings where screening programmes with ultrasonography are not implemented, most cases are diagnosed incidentally. Modern functional imaging techniques (PET, CT and MRI) may help to assess rupture risk. Elective repair of AAA with open surgery or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) should be considered to prevent AAA rupture, although the morbidity and mortality associated with both techniques remain non-negligible."
426725900018,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"How do similarities in spatial distributions and interspecific associations affect the coexistence of Quercus species in the Baotianman National Nature Reserve, Henan, China","Congeneric species often have similar ecological characteristics and use similar resources. These similarities may make it easier for them to co-occur in a similar habitat but may also lead to strong competitions that limit their coexistence. Hence, how do similarities in congeneric species affect their coexistence exactly? This study mainly used spatial point pattern analysis in two 1hm(2) plots in the Baotianman National Nature Reserve, Henan, China, to compare the similarities in spatial distributions and interspecific associations of Quercus species. Results revealed that Quercus species were all aggregated under the complete spatial randomness null model, and aggregations were weaker under the heterogeneous Poisson process null model in each plot. The interspecific associations of Quercus species to non-Quercus species were very similar in Plot 1. However, they can be either positive or negative in different plots between the co-occurring Quercus species. The spatial distributions of congeneric species, interspecific associations with non-Quercus species, neighborhood richness around species, and species diversity were all different between the two plots. We found that congeneric species did have some similarities, and the closely related congeneric species can positive or negative associate with each other in different plots. The co-occurring congeneric species may have different survival strategies in different habitats. On the one hand, competition among congenerics may lead to differentiation in resource utilization. On the other hand, their similar interspecific associations can strengthen their competitive ability and promote local exclusion to noncongeneric species to obtain more living space. Our results provide new knowledge for us to better understand the coexistence mechanisms of species."
434134200002,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS,Activity-based linkage and ranking methods for personal dataspace,"This research was conducted to alleviate desktop activity support deficiency, which occurs due to the lack of links between desktop resources. The research exploited information such as associations, contexts, and activity information about accesses to local resources, and translated this information into a personal linkage structure. More specifically, the research presented a novel approach to link and rank desktop resources by analysing users' activities over time, and exploited the associative links of resources from their implicit access patterns. Furthermore, multiple ranking methods, such as frequency of access, recency of access, focus time, and connectivity of resources, were proposed. Prototype systems were also developed, and a user study was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results showed that ranking desktop resources by their relevance - as carried out in this research - could improve activity-specific support, as well as overall performance in the area of personal information management."

446299600003,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Prediction of thermal conductance and friction coefficients at a solid-gas interface from statistical learning of collisions,"In this paper, we present the construction of statistical models of gas-wall collision based on data issued from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and use them to predict the velocity slip and temperature jump coefficients at the gas-solid interface. The Gaussian mixture (GM) model, an unsupervised learning technique, is chosen for this purpose. The model shares some similarities with the well-known Cercignani-Lampis model in kinetic theory but it is more robust due to the unlimited number of Gaussian functions used and the ability to deal with correlated data of high dimensions. Applications to real gas-wall systems (argon-gold and helium-gold) confirm the good performance of the model. The trained GM model predicts physical and statistical properties including accommodation, friction, and thermal conductance coefficients in excellent agreement with the MD model."
450523400004,MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT,Reduced oxygen concentration during in vitro oocyte maturation alters global DNA methylation in the maternal pronucleus of subsequent zygotes in cattle,"Preimplantation epigenetic reprogramming is sensitive to the environment of the gametes and the embryo. In vitro maturation (IVM) of bovine oocytes is a critical step of embryo in vitro production procedures and several factors influence its efficiency, including atmospheric oxygen tension. The possibility that the IVM environment can alter this process is tested by determining whether the global DNA methylation pattern (measured via immunofluorescent labeling of 5-methylcytosine [5meC]) in the parental pronuclei of bovine zygotes produced from cumulus-oocyte complexes matured under low (5%) and atmospheric (similar to 20%) oxygen tension. Normalized 5meC signals differed significantly between maternal and paternal pronuclei of oocytes matured in vitro at 5% oxygen (p <= 0.05). There was a significant difference of 5meC between maternal pronuclei of oocytes matured at 5% oxygen and 20% oxygen (p <= 0.05). The relative methylation level (normalized fluorescence intensity of paternal pronucleus divided by the normalized fluorescence intensity of maternal pronucleus) subsequent to maturation in vitro at 5% and 20% oxygen was also significantly altered (p <= 0.05). Our results show that the pattern of global DNA methylation in the maternal pronucleus of bovine zygotes is affected by maturing the oocytes under low oxygen tension which may have an impact on early embryonic development. These data may contribute to the understanding of possible effects of IVM conditions on pronucleus reprogramming."

Droplet transport actuated by PEW eliminates the need for electrode arrays and the complexities entailed in their fabrication and control, and offers a new approach for designing lab-on-a-chip applications.

439136000004,BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS,Tolerance and metabolic response of Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120 towards biomass hydrolysate-derived inhibitors,"Background: Bio-conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to high-value products offers numerous benefits; however, its development is hampered by chemical inhibitors generated during the pretreatment process. A better understanding of how microbes naturally respond to those inhibitors is valuable in the process of designing microorganisms with improved tolerance. Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120 is a natively tolerant strain that utilizes a wide range of carbon sources including pentose and hexose sugars. To this end, we investigated the tolerance and metabolic response of P. taiwanensis VLB120 towards biomass hydrolysate-derived inhibitors including organic acids (acetic acid, formic acid, and levulinic acid), furans (furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural), and phenols (vanillin). Results: The inhibitory effect of the tested compounds varied with respect to lag phase, specific growth rate, and biomass yield compared to the control cultures grown under the same conditions without addition of inhibitors. However, P. taiwanensis was able to oxidize vanillin and furfural to vanillic acid and 2-furoic acid, respectively. Vanillic acid was further metabolized, whereas 2-furoic acid was secreted outside the cells and remained in the fermentation broth without further conversion. Acetic acid and formic acid were completely consumed from the fermentation broth, while concentration of levulinic acid remained constant throughout the fermentation process. Analysis of free intracellular metabolites revealed varying levels when P. taiwanensis VLB120 was exposed to inhibitory compounds. This resulted in increased levels of ATP to export inhibitors from the cell and NADPH/NADP ratio that provides reducing power to deal with the oxidative stress caused by the inhibitors. Thus, adequate supply of these metabolites is essential for the survival and reproduction of P. taiwanensis in the presence of biomass-derived inhibitors. Conclusions: In this study, the tolerance and metabolic response of P. taiwanensis VLB120 to biomass hydrolysate-derived inhibitors was investigated. P. taiwanensis VLB120 showed high tolerance towards biomass hydrolysatederived inhibitors compared to most wild-type microbes reported in the literature. It adopts different resistance mechanisms, including detoxification, efflux, and repair, which require additional energy and resources. Thus, targeting redox and energy metabolism in strain engineering may be a successful strategy to overcome inhibition during biomass hydrolysate conversion and lead to development of more robust strains."
427650000001,ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING,On the mechanics of composite structure and electromagnetics of microstrip antenna,"Composite structures with desire mechanical properties can be tailored to embed microstrip antenna in aerospace systems for reducing aerodynamic disturbance. The performance of a rectangular microstrip antenna in composite structures is analyzed in spectral domain in this work. Analysis shows that the electromagnetics of antenna in spectral domain is similar to the mechanics of composite structure in space domain. The electrical field, the immittance (impedance or admittance), and the current density are equivalent to the stress, strain, and stiffness in mechanics of composite structures. The governing equations, though may be of different dimensions, are also similar. It shall be expected that the performance of a microstrip antenna on composite structures is different from that on isotropic structures; just as the mechanics of the former is so different from that of the latter. Analysis confirms that antenna performance depends on the structure's electromagnetic properties; similar to the mechanics of composite structures depends on the laminate layers' ply angle and stacking sequence."
442976800007,FLOW MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION,The determination of the flow characteristics of a low-pressure vapor-phase injector with a dynamic method,"Currently, the most widespread alternative fuel systems for combustion engines are low-pressure gas ones. When configuring such types of systems or when attempting to initiate simulation research, the flow characteristics of individual subassemblies, particularly the injectors need to be known. The equipment manufacturers only provide the volumetric flow rate at a given pressure without indicting whether the measurement was carried out under standardized guidelines. Therefore, the author attempted to determine the flow characteristics of low-pressure vapor-phase injectors using the 'tank' method following the guidelines of the JIS B 8390 standard. The copyrighted algorithm of throughput identification has been developed based on the flow model using the lumped elements method. Characteristics were determined depending on the injection time and depending on the opening frequency of the injector and linear increments in the investigated ranges were observed. The coefficient of determination adjusted to the degrees of freedom in both cases exceeded 99.9%. Compliance of the measurements using the proposed method with the flow meter measurements was confirmed. The maximum differences sometimes exceeded 5%. The paper presents the variability of the mass flow depending on the injection time and depending on the opening frequency of the injector. This is a basis in the course of modeling of the operation of engines or the assessment of the fuel consumption in simulation models of standardized driving cycles."
415391800004,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER,Discretization and implementation of a sharp interface model for interfacial heat and mass transfer during bubble growth,"Simulations of phase change rely on methods to compute heat and mass transfer at the interface. Current methods estimate the mass transfer with interpolation functions or by assuming a local temperature difference between saturation and interface. This work reports a method that uses a single cell around the interface to find the interfacial temperature gradient, and a linear interpolation normal to the interface to find the temperature of the mixture cell (cell with an interface). The one-cell algorithm for sharp interface and mass transfer (OCASIMAT) simplifies the estimation of the mass transfer and mixture cell temperature and improves accuracy. The proposed approach leads to a more realistic representation of the heat and mass transfer at the interface with a sharp discontinuity on the thermal properties at the interface and with mass transfer only at the cells with an interface. Simulations of planar interface evaporation and spherical bubble growth demonstrate the application of the proposed approach. Results indicate that OCASIMAT accurately predicts the temperature distributions near the interface and the interface displacements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
434868800052,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Fractionation, Bioaccessibility, and Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in the Soil of an Urban Recreational Area Amended with Composted Sewage Sludge","A composted sewage sludge (CSS) was added to the soil of an urban garden at 5%, 10%, and 25% (w/w soil) and stabilised for 180 days. Samples were then collected and analysed for total heavy metal concentrations, chemical fractions, and bioaccessibility, together with some physicochemical properties. The results showed that the total chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) concentrations were increased with CSS addition rate. The CSS addition decreased the residual fractions of these four elements. The exchangeable Cr, Cu, and Pb fractions were very small or not detected, while Zn exhibited an increasing trend in its exchangeable fraction with CSS addition rate. The bioaccessibility of these four elements was increased with the CSS addition rate. Moreover, the Cr, Cu, and Zn bioaccessibility correlated positively with the total concentration, while the bioaccessibility of these four elements exhibited a negative correlation with the residual fraction. The fractionation and bioaccessibility of heavy metals may have also been influenced by pH, cation exchange capacity, and organic matter. The risk assessment code reflected the amended soil showed no or low environmental risks for Cr, Cu, and Pb and a medium risk for Zn. The hazardous index values and cancer risk levels indicated that the heavy metals in the soil amended with 25% CSS posed negligible potential noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to children and adults via incidental ingestion."

The FeNC catalysts were synthesized from different nitrogen precursors and, as a result of this, exhibited quite distinct physical properties, such as BET surface areas and distinct chemical N-functionalities in varying ratios. The chemical diversity of the FeNC catalysts was harnessed to set up correlations between the catalytic CO2RR activity and their chemical nitrogen-functionalities, which provided a deeper understanding between catalyst chemistry and function. XPS measurements revealed a dominant role of porphyrin-like Fe-N-x motifs and pyridinic nitrogen species in catalyzing the overall reaction process. Operando EXAFS measurements revealed an unexpected change in the Fe oxidation state and associated coordination from Fe2+ to Fe1+. This redox change coincides with the onset of catalytic CH4 production around -0.9 V-RHE. The ability of the solid state coordinative Fe1+-N-x moiety to form hydrocarbons from CO2 is remarkable, as it represents the solid-state analogue to molecular Fe1+ coordination compounds with the same catalytic capability under homogeneous catalytic environments. This finding highlights a conceptual bridge between heterogeneous and homogenous catalysis and contributes significantly to our fundamental understanding of the FeNC catalyst function in the CO2RR."
455989100004,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,"You are what, where, and when you eat: seasonal and ontogenetic changes in a tropical tadpole's diet","Tadpole diet is likely to vary in response to environmental conditions and nutritional needs throughout growth and development. We investigated seasonal variation in diet composition of Bokermannohyla saxicola tadpoles and compared diets between two developmental stages with a significant difference in size. We found that the diet of B. saxicola tadpoles was dominated by periphytic algae, in accordance with their benthic habits. Considering number of cells ingested, tadpole trophic niches were broader in more advanced developmental stages. Tadpole trophic niches were narrower during the summer (wet season) than during the winter (dry season), which may reflect increased consumption of more energetic food items during the warm period when primary productivity is expected to be higher. Tadpole metabolism is likely to be higher in the summer and increased energetic needs might be supplied in this manner. However, results differed when biovolume was considered instead of number of cells ingested, with larger items assuming a greater importance and niches being usually larger in the summer. In these cases, the increased ingestion of diatoms (likely to be more nutritive) in the summer may decrease the relative importance of large algae (e.g., Mougeotia sp.) that form the bulk of the diet. Both food availability/accessibility and tadpole feeding behaviour driven by nutritional needs may influence patterns of food acquisition. Given the importance of biofilms to tadpole diet, studies on the mechanisms by which tadpole nutritional needs and environmental conditions interact are likely to provide important insights into the dynamics of aquatic food webs."
439342900015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING,Cardiac computed tomography compared with two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography for the detection and assessment of atrial septal pouches,"The aim of this study is to compare the two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (2D-TEE) with multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and with autopsied material to evaluate the ability and precision of the imaging methods for the detection and assessment of septal pouch (SP). One hundred and fifty patients that underwent both 2D-TEE and MSCT and 50 autopsied human hearts were investigated. In MSCT, the interatrial septum was classified as a left SP in 37.3%, right SP in 3.3%, and patent foramen ovale (PFO) channel in 3.3%. In 2D-TEE, the interatrial septum was classified as a left SP in 39.3%, right SP in 11.3%, double SP in 4.7%, and PFO channel in 2.0%. The weighted kappa coefficient between MSCT and 2D-TEE in assessing the septum morphology was 0.59. The prevalence of the left SP is lower when it is evaluated by MSCT or 2D-TEE than by anatomical study, but this difference is insignificant (37.3% vs. 44.0%, p = 0.40, and 39.3% vs. 44.0%, p = 0.56, respectively). The prevalence of left SPs is lower when detected by MSCT or 2D-TEE than during autopsy, but the difference is statistically insignificant (37.3% vs. 44.0%, p = 0.40, and 39.3% vs. 44.0%, p = 0.56, respectively). Both 2D-TEE and MSCT are comparable techniques for detecting left-sided SPs with the insignificant lower prevalence of detecting left-sided SPs compared to autopsied material. However, TEE with the contrast seems to be superior over MSCT due to the possibility of unambiguous PFO channel detection. Therefore, TEE with contrast should be preferred over MSCT in the identification of left-sided SPs."
424176700005,FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,Dynamics of gas cell coalescence during baking expansion of leavened dough,"The investigation of the dynamics of gas cell coalescence, i.e. a phenomenon that deteriorates the homogeneity of the cellular structure of bread crumb, was carried out performing simultaneously measurements of the dough volume, pressure, and viscosity. It was demonstrated that, during the baking expansion of chemically leavened wheat flour dough, the maximum growth rate of the gas cell radius determined from the ratio of pressure exerted by the expanded dough to its viscosity was on average four-fold lower than that calculated from volume changes in the gas phase of the dough. Such a high discrepancy was interpreted as a result of the course of coalescence, and a formula for determination of its rate was developed. The coalescence rate in the initial baking expansion phase had negative values, indicating nucleation of newly formed gas cells, which increased the number of gas cells even by 8%. In the next baking expansion phase, the coalescence rate started to exhibit positive values, reflecting dominance of the coalescence phenomenon over nucleation. The maximum coalescence rates indicate that, during the period of the most intensive dough expansion, the number of gas cells decreased by 2-3% within one second. At the end of the formation of bread crumb, the number of the gas cells declined by 55-67% in comparison with the initial value. The correctness of the results was positively verified using X-ray micro computed tomography. The developed method can be a useful tool for more profound exploration of the coalescence phenomenon at various stages of evolution of the cellular structure and its determinants, which may contribute to future development of more effective methods for improving the texture and sensory quality of bread crumb."
440959800028,GENE,SNAP23 suppresses cervical cancer progression via modulating the cell cycle,"Objective: Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most common gynecologic tumors in women worldwide, with poor prognosis and low survival rate. In this study, we identified SNAP23 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in CC. Methods: The expression of SNAP23 in tissues and cell lines were measured by qRT-PCR, western blot and IHC. Knockdown of SNAP23 by siRNA and ectopic expression of SNAP23 by overexpression plasmid were performed to observe the biological function of SNAP23 in CC. Xenograft nude mice models were established to measure its function in vivo. Results: SNAP23 was downregulated in CC tissues and had a negative correlation with advanced clinical characteristics. Ectopic expression of SNAP23 suppressed malignant phonotype of CC while knockdown of SNAP23 promoted the progression of CC in vitro. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that SNAP23 exerted its tumor suppressor activity via inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. Moreover, xenograft tumor models showed that SNAP23 suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Conclusions: Our results revealed that SNAP23 suppressed progression of CC and induced cell cycle G2/M arrest via upregulating p21(cip1) and downregulating CyclinB1."

This paper aims to examine the similarities and differences between English language and Chinese language publicity material networks and to reveal the core factors manifested in the publicity materials by choosing 1000 pieces of Chinese and English publicity materials as the study objects (500 pieces in each language). The core factors of 10 contemporary translation theories identified by the Delphi method are considered nodes; then, we link the nodes in accordance with their relevance among the core factors embodied in the translated publicity materials to draw network diagrams (the English language and Chinese language publicity material networks). Finally, we discuss appropriate contemporary translation theories that are suitable for guiding China's publicity translations and explore a new research perspective for the study of China's publicity translations."

The dependence of the conversion of the reactants and selectivity of the homo/heterocondensation process on the catalyst nature and temperature has been revealed. It has been shown that the maximum acrolein selectivity is reached in the case of using benzoyl-substituted derivatives in water, with the proportion of the products of further condensation decreasing. The selectivity for the ethanal homocondensation product 2-butenal decreases simultaneously as a result of the formation of linear and branched oligomers of successive condensation."
448475100017,GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS,On the Scales of Dynamic Topography in Whole-Mantle Convection Models,"Mantle convection shapes Earth's surface by generating dynamic topography. Observational constraints and regional convection models suggest that surface topography could be sensitive to mantle flow for wavelengths as short as 1,000 and 250 km, respectively. At these spatial scales, surface processes including sedimentation and relative sea-level change occur on million-year timescales. However, time-dependent global mantle flow models do not predict small-scale dynamic topography yet. Here we present 2-D spherical annulus numerical models of mantle convection with large radial and lateral viscosity contrasts. We first identify the range of Rayleigh number, internal heat production rate and yield stress for which models generate plate-like behavior, surface heat flow, surface velocities, and topography distribution comparable to Earth's. These models produce both whole-mantle convection and small-scale convection in the upper mantle, which results in small-scale (<500 km) to large-scale (>10(4) km) dynamic topography, with a spectral power for intermediate scales (500 to 10(4) km) comparable to estimates of present-day residual topography. Timescales of convection and the associated dynamic topography vary from five to several hundreds of millions of years. For a Rayleigh number of 10(7), we investigate how lithosphere yield stress variations (10-50 MPa) and the presence of deep thermochemical heterogeneities favor small-scale (200-500 km) and intermediate-scale (500-10(4) km) dynamic topography by controlling the formation of small-scale convection and the number and distribution of subduction zones, respectively. The interplay between mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics generates a complex spatial and temporal pattern of dynamic topography consistent with constraints for Earth."
440964100002,AFRICAN JOURNALISM STUDIES,Journalism Education Interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Examination of the Norwegian Model in Ethiopia,"Recent trends in journalism education in Africa indicate a substantial increase both in scope and specialisation. While this increase is usually attributed to higher education institutions' response to market trends, certain journalism education programmes are born out of development assistance initiatives that envision nation-building imperatives of democratisation and development. The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) is notable for its involvement in higher education journalism training at a graduate level in select countries in the Global South. This article assesses the presently discontinued involvement of NORAD in the establishment of a graduate journalism programme at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia between 2004-2007. In doing so, it reviews what has been learned over the lifespan of NORAD's sponsorship of the programme by discussing what worked and what did not work Findings generated from document analysis, an online survey, and interviews indicate the project fell short of its mission due to its top-down, ""magic-bullet"" conceptualisation of democratisation that failed to take into account the political and legalrational conundrums of the Ethiopian state. However, unanticipated yet useful contributions emerged from the project in terms of forging small-scale partnerships that yielded favourable results in the development of journalism education in sub-Saharan Africa."

Here we present the first systematic investigation and evidence for bacteria-free exclusion zones for several bacterial strains, including pathogens associated with hospital infections and/or foodborne outbreaks: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia colt O157:H7, and Listeria monocytogenes. Tests were carried out both in a phosphate buffer, as well as triptic soy broth (TSB) of high ionic strength. Bacterial cell density distribution at the Nafion-liquid interface was visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. A robust image analysis method was developed to generate a profile of cell concentration near the interface and quantify EZ size. Results revealed an exclusion zone (EZ) of 40-60 mu m and a transition zone (TZ) of 40-80 mu m for bacterial cells suspended in tryptic soy broth. There were no statistical differences in the size of EZ and TZ for the bacterial strains tested with the same substrate, but differences existed for different substrates tested, implying a physicochemical underpinning for EZ. In a test conducted with E. coli, cells progressively penetrated EZ over 2 days. Furthermore, EZ-bearing Nafion had 80% less biomass accumulation of E. coli over 2 days compared to an EZ-less, hydrophilic, smooth aluminum oxide surface. This suggests that EZ may represent the first line of defense, spatially and temporally, against bacteria approaching certain hydrophilic surfaces. These findings could have important implications in developing biofouling-resistant material surfaces for applications sensitive to bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

422909900001,PROBABILITY IN THE ENGINEERING AND INFORMATIONAL SCIENCES,MYOPIC POLICIES FOR NON-PREEMPTIVE SCHEDULING OF JOBS WITH DECAYING VALUE,"In many scheduling applications, minimizing delays is of high importance. One adverse effect of such delays is that the reward for completion of a job may decay over time. Indeed in healthcare settings, delays in access to care can result in worse outcomes, such as an increase in mortality risk. Motivated by managing hospital operations in disaster scenarios, as well as other applications in perishable inventory control and information services, we consider non-preemptive scheduling of jobs whose internal value decays over time. Because solving for the optimal scheduling policy is computationally intractable, we focus our attention on the performance of three intuitive heuristics: (1) a policy which maximizes the expected immediate reward, (2) a policy which maximizes the expected immediate reward rate, and (3) a policy which prioritizes jobs with imminent deadlines. We provide performance guarantees for all three policies and show that many of these performance bounds are tight. In addition, we provide numerical experiments and simulations to compare how the policies perforin in a variety of scenarios. Our theoretical and numerical results allow us to establish rules-of-thumb for applying these heuristics in a variety of situations, including patient scheduling scenarios."
431123900011,JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE,The Synaptic Properties of Cells Define the Hallmarks of Interval Timing in a Recurrent Neural Network,"Extensive research has described two key features of interval timing. The bias property is associated with accuracy and implies that time is overestimated for short intervals and underestimated for long intervals. The scalar property is linked to precision and states that the variability of interval estimates increases as a function of interval duration. The neural mechanisms behind these properties are not well understood. Here we implemented a recurrent neural network that mimics a cortical ensemble and includes cells that show paired-pulse facilitation and slow inhibitory synaptic currents. The network produces interval selective responses and reproduces both bias and scalar properties when a Bayesian decoder reads its activity. Notably, the interval-selectivity, timing accuracy, and precision of the network showed complex changes as a function of the decay time constants of the modeled synaptic properties and the level of background activity of the cells. These findings suggest that physiological values of the time constants for paired-pulse facilitation and GABAb, as well as the internal state of the network, determine the bias and scalar properties of interval timing."

Dimercaprol, as a chelating agent of Au(III), was applied for the loading of Au(III) on cellulose aerogel. The new organogold compound after characterization was used as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the oxidation reactions of aliphatic alcohols, benzyl alcohol, and ethylbenzene. Excellent selectivities and good conversions were obtained in the green oxidation reactions of alcohols and ethylbenzene. The high porosity of cellulose aerogel led to the good conversions with the low catalyst amounts. The significance of the presented work is the introducing of an environmentally benign process for the oxidation reactions based on a biocompatible catalyst."
427351400005,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Third-harmonic entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering over a frequency range of more than an octave,"The development of quantum technologies which use quantum states of the light field interacting with other systems creates a demand for such states over wide frequency ranges. In this work we compare the bipartite entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-steering properties of the two different parametric schemes which produce third-harmonic optical fields from an input field at the fundamental frequency. The first scheme uses second harmonic cascaded with sum-frequency generation, while the second uses triply degenerate four-wave mixing, also known as direct third-harmonic generation. We find that both schemes produce continuous-variable bipartite entanglement and EPR steering over a frequency range which has previously been unobtainable. The direct scheme produces a greater degree of EPR steering, while the cascaded scheme allows for greater flexibility in having three available bipartitions, thus allowing for greater flexibility in the tailoring of light matter interfaces. There are also parameter regimes in both for which classical mean-field analyses fail to predict the mean-field solutions. Both schemes may be very useful for applications in quantum communication and computation networks, as well as providing for quantum interfaces between a wider range of light and atomic ensembles than is presently practicable."
425333200005,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY,Size discrimination in barn owls as compared to humans,"We tested how well barn owls can discriminate objects of different sizes. This ability may be important for the owls when catching prey. We performed a quantitative experiment in the laboratory and trained owls in a task in which the owls had to discriminate whether two rhombi presented simultaneously on a computer monitor were of the same or of different sizes. We obtained full data sets with two experienced owls and one data point with a third owl. For objects being sufficiently larger than the spatial resolution of the barn owl, the angular threshold was related to object size, implying that the discrimination followed Weber's law. The range of Weber fractions we determined was between 0.026 and 0.09. For object sizes close to the spatial resolution, performance degraded. We conducted similar experiments with human subjects. Human thresholds showed the same dependence on object size, albeit down to smaller object sizes. Human performance resulted in a range of Weber fractions extending from 0.025 to 0.036. The differences between owls and humans could be explained by the much higher spatial acuity of humans compared with owls."
434236700042,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,Monitoring the Doping and Diffusion Characteristics of Mn Dopants in Cesium Lead Halide Perovskites,"Cesium lead perovskites, in the form of CsPbX3 or Cs4PbX6, have been widely used for various optoelectronic applications due to their exceptionally good optical properties. In this study, the effect of Mn doping on the structural and optical properties of cesium lead halide perovskite crystals are investigated from both experimental and theoretical points of view. It is found that adding MnCl2 during the synthesis not only leads to a Mn-driven structural phase transition from Cs4PbBr6 to CsPbCl3 but also triggers the Br- to Cl- halide exchange. On the other hand, it is observed that, under UV illumination, the color of Mn-doped crystals changes from orange to blue in approximately 195 h. While the intensity of Mn-originated photoluminescence emission exponentially decays in time, the intensity of CsPbCI3-originated emission remains unchanged. In addition, diffusive motion of Mn ions results in both a growing population of MnO2 at the surface and transition of the host into a cesium-rich Cs4PbCl6 phase."

Design: Six-month nonrandomized phase 2 clinical trial. Setting: Urban garden and remote platforms. Participants: Overweight and obese cancer survivors post active treatment. Intervention: Remote tele-MI from a trained registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). Main Outcome Measures: Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Analysis: Groups were stratified as users and nonusers based on tele-MI use. Qualitative survey data and remote MI interaction logs were analyzed for trends. Two-sample t tests were performed to assess pre-post intervention changes in physical activity and dietary behaviors, quality of life, self-efficacy, and clinical biomarkers. Results: A total of 29 participants completed the intervention. There were 17 tele-MI users (59%) and 12 nonusers (41%). Users were primarily female (88%), breast cancer survivors (59%), college educated (82%), with a mean age of 58 years. Users set 50% more goals, lost more weight (4.8 vs 2.6 kg), significantly improved quality of life (P = .03), and trended more positively in clinical biomarkers (eg, cholesterol, blood pressure) than did nonusers. Conclusions and Implications: Findings from this study indicate that tele-MI is a feasible and acceptable intervention for overweight cancer survivors after active therapy. Larger randomized trials are needed to establish efficacy and generalizability to a variety of demographic populations."
441850400068,PLOS ONE,Deubiquitinase inhibitor PR-619 reduces Smad4 expression and suppresses renal fibrosis in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from their substrates and, together with ubiquitin ligases, play an important role in the regulation of protein expression. Although transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1-Smad signaling is a central pathway of renal fibrosis, the role of DUBs in the expression of TGF-beta receptors and Smads during the development of renal fibrosis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether PR-619, a pan-DUB inhibitor, suppresses fibrosis in mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and TGF-beta 1-stimulated normal rat kidney (NRK)-49F cells, a rat renal fibroblast cell line. Either the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) or PR-619 (100 mu g) was intraperitoneally administered to mice after UUO induction once a day for 7 days. Administration of PR-619 attenuated renal fibrosis with downregulation of mesenchymal markers, extracellular matrix proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and the TGF-beta 1 mRNA level in UUO mice. Although type I TGF-beta receptor (TGF-beta RI), Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 protein expression levels were markedly increased in mice with UUO, administration of PR-619 suppressed only Smad4 expression but not TGF-beta RI, Smad2, or Smad3 expression. PR-619 also had an inhibitory effect on TGF-beta 1-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and reduced Smad4 levels in NRK-49F cells. Our results indicate that PR-619 ameliorates renal fibrosis, which is accompanied by the reduction of Smad4 expression."
441863900010,IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS,On the coupling of model predictive control and robust Kalman filtering,"Model predictive control (MPC) represents nowadays one of the main methods employed for process control in industry. Its strong suits comprise a simple algorithm based on a straightforward formulation and the flexibility to deal with constraints. On the other hand, it can be questioned its robustness regarding model uncertainties and external noises. Thus, a lot of efforts have been spent in the past years into the search of methods to address these shortcomings. In this study, the authors propose a robust MPC controller which stems from the idea of adding robustness in the prediction phase of the algorithm while leaving the core of MPC untouched. More precisely, they consider a robust Kalman filter that has been recently introduced and they further extend its usability to feedback control systems. Overall the proposed control algorithm allows to maintain all of the advantages of MPC with an additional improvement in performance and without any drawbacks in terms of computational complexity. To test the actual reliability of the algorithm, they apply it to control a servomechanism system characterised by non-linear dynamics."

To discover new genetic loci associated with cCSC and to better understand the causative mechanism of this disease, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on patients with cCSC. OBJECTIVE To discover new genetic loci and pathways associated with cCSC and to predict the association of genetic variants with gene expression in patients with cCSC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case-control GWAS was completed in the general community, 3 referral university medical centers, and outpatient care on Europeans individuals with cCSC and population-based control participants. Genotype data was collected from May 2013 to August 2017, and data analysis occurred from August 2017 to November 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, haplotypes, genetic pathways, and predicted gene expression with cCSC. RESULTS A total of 521 patients with cCSC (median age, 51 years; interquartile range [IQR], 44-59 years; 420 [80.6%] male) and 3577 European population-based control participants (median age, 52 years; IQR. 37-71 years; 1630 [45.6%] male) were included. One locus on chromosome 1 at the complement factor H (CFH) gene reached genome-wide significance and was associated with an increased risk of cCSC (rs1329428; odds ratio [OR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.38-1.80]; P = 3.12 x 10(-11)). The CFH haplotypes H1 and H3 were protective for cCSC (HI: OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.53-0.77]; P = 2.18 x 10(-6); H3: OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.42-0.70]; P = 2.49 x 10(-6)), whereas haplotypes H2, H4, H5, and the aggregate of rare CFH haplotypes conferred increased risk (H2: OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30-1.89]; P = 2.18 x 10(-6); H4: OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.13-1.80]; P = 2.49 x 10(-3); HS: OR, 1.80 [95% Cl, 1.36-2.39]; P = 4.61 x 10(-5); rare haplotypes: OR, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.43-2.77]; P = 4.59 x 10(-5)). Pathway analyses showed involvement of the complement cascade and alternative open reading frame (ARF) pathway in cCSC. Using PrediXcan, we identified changes in predicted expression of complement genes CFH, complement factor H related 1(CFHR1), complement factor related 4 (CFHR4), and membrane cofactor protein (MCP/CD46), Additionally, the potassium sodium-activated channel subfamily T member 2 (KCNT2) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10a (TNFRSF10A) genes were differentially expressed in patients with cCSC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this GWAS on cCSC, we identified a locus on chromosome 1 at the CFH gene that was significantly associated with cCSC, and we report protective and risk-conferring haplotypes in this gene. Pathway analyses were enriched for complement genes, and gene expression analysis suggests a role for CFH, CFHR1, CFHR4, CD46, KCNT2, and TNFRSF70A in the disease. Taken together, these results underscore the potential importance of the complement pathway in the causative mechanisms of cCSC."

Study design: This was a retrospective review of cases of fetal tachycardia that occurred from 2004 to 2006. Data were collected from questionnaires that were sent to all 750 secondary or tertiary perinatal care centers in Japan. Results: Eighty-two cases (14 with fetal hydrops) were analyzed (supraventricular tachycardia [SVT], n=52; atrial flutter [AFL], n=23; and ventricular tachycardia, n=7). The overall mortality was 3.7%. Intrauterine treatment was performed for 41 fetuses (50.0%). Digoxin, flecainide and sotalol were mainly used for SVT and AFL. Fetal tachycardia resolved in 90.0% (27/30) of the cases without fetal hydrops and 90.9% (10/11) of the cases with fetal hydrops. Intrauterine treatment significantly reduced the incidence of cesarean delivery (29.3 vs. 70.7%, p<.01), preterm birth (12.2 vs. 41.5%, p=.02) and neonatal arrhythmias (48.8 vs. 78.0%, p=.01) in comparison to untreated fetuses. Conclusions: This nationwide survey revealed that intrauterine treatment was performed for approximately half of the cases of fetal tachycardia and was associated with lower rates of cesarean delivery, premature birth and neonatal arrhythmias in comparison to untreated fetuses."

CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old man with a history of VZV presented with a 6-month history of chest pain, flulike symptoms, and left-sided headaches. Several concomitant external calvarial lesions were identified, and imaging was concerning for an infectious or neoplastic etiology. The patient underwent surgical debridement, and pathologic samples identified coinfection with P. acnes and VZV. Antibacterial and antiviral therapy resulted in a good outcome. CONCLUSION: Osteomyelitis resulting as a complication of VZV infection is rare, particularly in the calvaria. This is the first reported case of Ramsay-Hunt syndrome-type VZV infection being complicated by osteomyelitis of the calvaria. Our case also demonstrates the diagnosis of VZV osteomyelitis through the use of current pathologic methods."
425566700007,DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING,A Guidelines framework for understandable BPMN models,"Business process modeling allows abstracting and reasoning on how work is structured within complex organizations. Business process models represent blueprints that can serve different purposes for a variety of stakeholders. For example, business analysts can use these models to better understand how the organization works; employees playing a role in the process can use them to learn the tasks that they are supposed to perform; software analysts/developers can refer to the models to understand the system-as-is before designing the system-to-be. Given the variety of stakeholders that need to interpret these models, and considering the pivotal function that models play within organizations, understandability becomes a fundamental quality that need to be taken into particular account by modelers. In this paper we provide a set of fifty guidelines that can help modelers to improve the understandability of their models. The work focuses on the Business Process Modelling Notation 2.0 standard published by the Object Management Group, which has acquired a clear predominance among the modeling notations for business processes. Guidelines were derived by means of a thoughtful literature review which allowed identifying around one hundred guidelines and through successive activities of synthesis and homogenization. In addition, we implemented a freely available open source tool, named BEBOP (understandaBility vErifier for Business Process models), to check the adherence of a model to the guidelines. Finally, guidelines violation has been checked with BEBOP on a dataset of 11,294 models available in a publicly accessible repository. Our tests show that, although the majority of the guidelines are respected by the models, some guidelines, which are recognized as fundamental by the literature, are frequently violated."
446506700002,JOURNALISM STUDIES,Networking and Political Alignment as Strategies to Control the News: Interaction between journalists and politicians,"Political coverage is strongly influenced by interactions between journalists and political actors. Especially for political actors, these interactions present an opportunity to increase their influence on the news. However, what strategies political actors use in their attempts to steer political journalists when exchanging with them has not been studied comprehensively and on a broad basis. Furthermore, some studies suggest that interactions are dominated by political actors, while others conclude that journalists are at least equally influential. Building on extant research, we first draw an inventory of strategies used by political actors in their exchanges with journalists and investigate their importance based on a mixed-methods study. Our study was conducted in Austria and included a full sample of N=173 political journalists surveyed with a standardized instrument, and open interviews with 10 additional journalists and 10 political actors. Results show that politicians build political alliances, network with specific journalists, and use intimidation as strategies to control the interactions. In the survey, journalists mentioned basing exchanges on political alignment as the most important strategy. While this strategy indeed helps politicians to control coverage, networking strategies benefit journalists."
454206200015,PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE,Incidence and Outcomes after Out-of-Hospital Medical Emergencies in Gambia: A Case for the Integration of Prehospital Care and Emergency Medical Services in Primary Health Care,"Background: The Gambia is going through a rapid epidemiologic transition with a dual disease burden of infections and non-communicable diseases occurring at the same time. Acute, time-sensitive, medical emergencies such as trauma, obstetric emergencies, respiratory failure, and stroke are leading causes of morbidity and mortality among adults in the country. Problem: Data on medical emergency care and outcomes are lacking in The Gambia. Data on self-reported medical emergencies among adults in a selection of Gambian communities are presented in this report. Methods: A total of 320 individuals were surveyed from 34 communities in the greater Banjul area of The Gambia using a survey instrument estimating the incidence of acute medical emergencies in an adult population. Self-reported travel time to a health facility during medical emergencies and patterns of health-seeking behavior with regard to type of facility visited and barriers to accessing emergency care, including cost and medical insurance coverage, are presented in this report. Results: Of the 320 individuals surveyed, 262 agreed to participate resulting in a response rate of 82%. Fifty-two percent of respondents reported an acute medical emergency in the preceding year that required urgent evaluation at a health facility. The most common facility visited during such emergencies was a health center. Eighty-seven percent of respondents reported a travel time of less than one hour during medical emergencies. Out-of-pocket cost of medications accounted for the highest expenditure during emergencies. There was a low awareness and willingness to subscribe to health insurance among individuals surveyed. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of acute medical emergencies among adults in The Gambia which are associated with adverse outcomes due to a combination of poor health literacy, high out-of-pocket expenditures on medications, and poor access to timely prehospital emergency care. There is an urgent need to develop prehospital acute care and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the primary health sector as part of a strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity in the country."
436836800003,JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY,Computed tomography angiography-fluoroscopy image fusion allows visceral vessel cannulation without angiography during fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair,"Background: Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is an evolving technique to treat juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Catheterization of visceral and renal vessels after the deployment of the fenestrated main body device is often challenging, usually requiring additional fluoroscopy and multiple digital subtraction angiograms. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility and accuracy of a computed tomography angiography (CTA)-fluoroscopy image fusion technique in guiding visceral vessel cannulation during FEVAR. Methods: Between August 2014 and September 2016, all consecutive patients who underwent FEVAR at our institution using image fusion guidance were included. Preoperative CTA images were fused with intraoperative fluoroscopy after coregistering with non-contrast-enhanced cone beam computed tomography (syngo 3D3D image fusion; Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). The ostia of the visceral vessels were electronically marked on CTA images (syngo iGuide Toolbox) and overlaid on live fluoroscopy to guide vessel cannulation after fenestrated device deployment. Clinical utility of image fusion was evaluated by assessing the number of dedicated angiograms required for each visceral or renal vessel cannulation and the use of optimized C-arm angulation. Accuracy of image fusion was evaluated from video recordings by three raters using a binary qualitative assessment scale. Results: A total of 26 patients (17 men; mean age, 73.8 years) underwent FEVAR during the study period for juxtarenal AAA (17), pararenal AAA (6), and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (3). Video recordings of fluoroscopy from 19 cases were available for review and assessment. A total of 46 vessels were cannulated; 38 of 46 (83%) of these vessels were cannulated without angiography but based only on image fusion guidance: 9 of 11 superior mesenteric artery cannulations and 29 of 35 renal artery cannulations. Binary qualitative assessment showed that 90% (36/40) of the virtual ostia overlaid on live fluoroscopy were accurate. Optimized C-arm angulations were achieved in 35% of vessel cannulations (0/9 for superior mesenteric artery cannulation, 12/25 for renal arteries). Conclusions: Preoperative CTA-fluoroscopy image fusion guidance during FEVAR is a valuable and accurate tool that allows visceral and renal vessel cannulation without the need of dedicated angiograms, thus avoiding additional injection of contrast material and radiation exposure. Further refinements, such as accounting for device-induced aortic deformation and automating the image fusion workflow, will bolster this technology toward optimal routine clinical use."
430979100010,ALGORITHMICA,"On (1, epsilon)-Restricted Max-Min Fair Allocation Problem","We study the max-min fair allocation problem in which a set of m indivisible items are to be distributed among n agents such that the minimum utility among all agents is maximized. In the restricted setting, the utility of each item j on agent i is either 0 or some non-negative weight w(j). For this setting, Asadpour et al. (ACM Trans Algorithms 8(3):24, 2012) showed that a certain configuration-LP can be used to estimate the optimal value to within a factor of 4 + delta, for any delta > 0, which was recently extended by Annamalai et al. (in: Indyk (ed) Proceedings of the twenty-sixth annual ACMSIAM symposium on discrete algorithms, SODA 2015, San Diego, CA, USA, January 4-6, 2015) to give a polynomial-time 13-approximation algorithm for the problem. For hardness results, Bezakova and Dani (SIGecom Exch 5(3):11-18, 2005) showed that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within any ratio smaller than 2. In this paper we consider the (1, epsilon)-restricted max-min fair allocation problem in which each item j is either heavy (w(j) = 1) or light (w(j) = epsilon), for some parameter epsilon is an element of (0, 1). We show that the (1, epsilon)-restricted case is also NP-hard to approximate within any ratio smaller than 2. Using the configuration-LP, we are able to estimate the optimal value of the problem to within a factor of 3+delta, for any delta > 0. Extending this idea, we also obtain a quasi-polynomial time (3 + 4 epsilon)-approximation algorithm and a polynomial time 9-approximation algorithm. Moreover, we show that as epsilon tends to 0, the approximation ratio of our polynomial-time algorithm approaches 3+2 root 2 approximate to 5.83."

However, a highly efficient and selective catalyst for this process remains to be developed. In this study, density functional theory calculations indicate that steric hindrance in monolayer molybdenum sulfide with 2S vacancies (DV-MoS2) can facilitate the conversion of CO into CH4 with high activity and selectivity under electrochemical reduction at a low potential of -0.53 V vs. RHE and ambient conditions. The potential is a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art Cu electrode (-0.74 V vs. RHE), with less electrical energy. Moreover, the results suggest that such steric hindrance effects are important for structure-sensitive catalytic reactions."
446175500014,PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY,Health-related quality of life and psychological distress among cancer survivors in a middle-income country,"Objectives: Quality of life and psychological well-being are important patient-centered outcomes, which are useful in evaluation of cancer care delivery. However, evidence from low-income and middle-income countries remains scarce. We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prevalence of psychological distress (anxiety or depression), as well as their predictors, among cancer survivors in a middle-income setting. Methods: Through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Costs in Oncology study, 1490 newly diagnosed cancer patients were followed-up in Malaysia for 1 year. Health-related quality of life was assessed by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D) dimension questionnaires at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Psychological distress was assessed by using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Data were modeled by using general linear and logistic regressions analyses. Results: One year after diagnosis, the mean EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health score of the cancer survivors remained low at 53.0 over 100 (SD 21.4). Fifty-four percent of survivors reported at least moderate levels of anxiety, while 27% had at least moderate levels of depression. Late stage at diagnosis was the strongest predictor of low HRQoL. Increasing age, being married, high-income status, hospital type, presence of comorbidities, and chemotherapy administration were also associated with worse HRQoL. The significant predictors of psychological distress were cancer stage and hospital type. Conclusion: Cancer survivors in this middle-income setting have persistently impaired HRQoL and high levels of psychological distress. Development of a holistic cancer survivorship program addressing wider aspects of well-being is urgently needed in our settings."
442047000004,REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE,The professional space of nursing: an analysis based on the case of French-speaking Switzerland,"The nursing profession is experiencing rapid numerical growth in all Western countries. With the proliferation of non-hospital sectors, the academicisation of training and the establishment of distinct hierarchies, this growth is accompanied by a process of horizontal as well as vertical differentiation. In such a context, it is important to reconsider the issues that run throughout this occupation by taking into account all of its sectors of activity at the scale of a specific geographical area. A combination of multiple correspondence analysis and cluster analysis, carried out on a representative sample of nurses from French-speaking Switzerland (n = 2,923) reveals a nursing space in which four segments can be identified: ""medically dominant"", ""medically dominated"", ""nursing elites"" and ""heterodox"". Each of these segments is characterized by specific representations and practices, whether in the spaces of the practice of care, production of knowledge or relationship with the medical profession."
425198000004,INFORMATION SCIENCES,Map matching for low-sampling-rate GPS trajectories by exploring real-time moving directions,"Map matching is the process of matching a series of recorded geographic coordinates (e.g., a GPS trajectory) to a road network. Due to GPS positioning errors and the sampling constraints, the GPS data collected by the GPS devices are not precise, and the location of a user cannot always be correctly shown on the map. Therefore, map matching is an important preprocessing step for many applications such as navigation systems, traffic flow analysis, and autonomous cars. Unfortunately, most current map-matching algorithms only consider the distance between the GPS points and the road segments, the topology of the road network, and the speed constraint of the road segment to determine the matching results. Moreover, most current map-matching algorithms cannot handle the matching errors at junctions. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal based matching algorithm (STD matching) for low-sampling-rate GPS trajectories. STD-matching considers (1) the spatial features such as the distance information and topology of the road network, (2) the speed constraints of the road network, and (3) the real-time moving direction which shows the movement of the user. Moreover, we also reduce the running time by performing GPS clustering, GPS smoothing, and the A* shortest path algorithms. In our experiments, we compare STD-matching with three existing algorithms, the ST-matching algorithm, the stMM algorithm, and the HMM-RCM algorithm, using a real data set. The experiment results show that our STD-matching algorithm outperforms the three existing algorithms in terms of matching accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
426211800010,CORROSION,High-Accuracy Ultrasonic Corrosion Rate Monitoring,"Ultrasonic testing with permanently installed transducers is widely used for online corrosion monitoring in the field. In this paper, a carefully optimized ultrasonic corrosion monitoring technique for performing measurements in the laboratory is presented. It is shown that for thickness measurements of a 10 mm steel component, a repeatability of similar to 40 nm can be maintained over the period of a day. The technique has been applied to monitoring the wall losses of a steel sample during driven and free corrosion experiments. All ultrasonic wall loss measurements reported have been validated by optical surface profile scans and, where possible, by analytical predictions based on Faraday's law. Further analysis of the results shows that wall loss rates of the order of 0.1 mm/y to 0.2 mm/y can be detected within 1 h to 2 h. This state-of-the-art laboratory technique is highly accurate and responsive, and possesses the potential for becoming a powerful alternative corrosion assessment tool that is convenient to use."
454155400003,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Lorentz ratio of a compensated metal,"A violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in a metal can be quantified by comparing the Lorentz ratio, L =kappa rho/T, where kappa is the thermal conductivity and rho is the electrical resistivity, with the universal Sommerfeld constant, L-0 = (pi(2)/3 )(k(B)/e)(2). We obtain the Lorentz ratio of a clean compensated metal with intercarrier interaction as the dominant scattering mechanism by solving exactly the system of coupled integral Boltzmann equations. The Lorentz ratio is shown to assume a particular simple form in the forward-scattering limit: L/L-0 = (Theta(2))over bar/2, where Theta is the scattering angle. In this limit, L/L-0 can be arbitrarily small. We also show how the same result can be obtained without the benefit of an exact solution. We discuss how a strong downward violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in a type-II Weyl semimetal WP2 can be explained within our model."
450620700001,APPLIED OPTICS,Study of an image autofocus method based on power threshold function wavelet reconstruction and a quality evaluation algorithm,"As a key component in optical microscopy imaging systems, autofocus technology has a significant effect on imaging quality. In this paper, an optical microscopy autofocus method that includes a wavelet denoising algorithm based on a power threshold function and a Brenner image quality evaluation algorithm is presented. Experimental results show that the power threshold function wavelet denoising algorithm, which can be adopted to obtain more realistic optical images, is superior to the traditional soft, hard, hyperbolic, and exponential threshold functions in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, mean squared error, and histogram indicators; moreover, compared to the Roberts, sum modulus difference (SMD), and energy gradient functions, the Brenner image quality evaluation algorithm can be used to quickly and accurately lock onto the focal plane. By integrating and applying these two core algorithms in the autofocus image acquisition system of a microscope, the image sharpness and focusing quality are greatly improved, which benefits the further evaluation of images.

436159700001,FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY,Effect of Gender on Chronic Intermittent Hypoxic Fosb Expression in Cardiorespiratory-Related Brain Structures in Mice,"We aimed to delineate sex-based differences in neuroplasticity that may be associated with previously reported sex-based differences in physiological alterations caused by repetitive succession of hypoxemia-reoxygenation encountered during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We examined long-term changes in the activity of brainstem and diencephalic cardiorespiratory neuronal populations induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) in male and female mice by analyzing Fosb expression. Whereas the overall baseline and CIH-induced Fosb expression in females was higher than in males, possibly reflecting different neuroplastic dynamics, in contrast, structures responded to CIH by Fosb upregulation in males only. There was a sex-based difference at the level of the rostral ventrolateral reticular nucleus of the medulla, with an increase in the number of FOSB/Delta FOSB-positive cells induced by CIH in males but not females. This structure contains neurons that generate the sympathetic tone and which are involved in CIH-induced sustained hypertension during waking hours. We suggest that the sex-based difference in neuroplasticity of this structure contributes to the reported sex-based difference in CIH-induced hypertension. Moreover, we highlighted a sex-based dimorphic phenomenon in serotoninergic systems induced by CIH, with increased serotoninergic immunoreactivity in the hypoglossal nucleus and a decreased number of serotoninergic cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus in male but not female mice. We suggest that this dimorphism in the neuroplasticity of serotoninergic systems predisposes males to a greater alteration of neuronal control of the upper respiratory tract associated with the greater collapsibility of upper airways described in male OSA subjects."
431718300038,OPTICS EXPRESS,Thermally controlled Si photonic crystal slow light waveguide beam steering device,"The doubly periodic Si photonic crystal waveguide radiates the guided slow light into free space as an optical beam. The waveguide also functions as a beam steering device, in which the steering angle is changed substantially by a slight variation in the wavelength generated due to the large angular dispersion of the slow light. A similar function is obtained when the wavelength is fixed and the refractive index of the waveguide is changed. In this study, we tested two kinds of integrated heater structures and observed the beam steering using the thermo-optic effect. For a p-i-p doped waveguide, the heating current was made to flow directly across the waveguide and a beam steering range of 21 degrees was obtained with a relatively low heating power and high-speed response of the order of 100 kHz, maintaining a narrow beam divergence of 0.1-0.3 degrees and a 120 resolution points. We also performed a preliminary life test of the device but did not observe any severe degradation in the temperature variation of 80-430 K for the duration up to 20-40 h. For a TiN heater device, we obtained the comparable beam steering characteristics, but the required heating power increased, and the response speed decreased drastically.

The polymers have shown maximum dielectric constant at low applied frequency 50Hz at 393K due to the space charge polarization. The AC conductivity and activation energy of polymers were arrived from dielectric constant and dielectric loss values. PBIs were synthesized by the oxidative polycondensation of benzimidazole monomers, 2-(1H-benzo [d] imidazole-2-yl)-4-bromophenol (BIBP), and 2-(1H-benzo [d] imidazole-2-yl)-6-methoxyphenol (BIMP) in an aqueous alkaline medium using NaOCl as oxidant. The monomers and polymers were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. Fluorescence spectra of monomers and polymers showed their (max) emission in the region of 472-479 and 463-472nm respectively. The electrical conductivities of iodine doped polybenzimidazoles were measured by four-point probe technique and it increases with increase in iodine vapour contact time. The electrical conductivity values were correlated with the charge density on imidazole nitrogen obtained from Huckel calculation method. Both the PBI are having reasonably good thermal stability and are shown by high carbines residues of around 40% at 500 degrees C in thermogravimetric analysis."
436032200037,RSC ADVANCES,Hydrothermally grown CdS nanoparticles for photodegradation of anionic azo dyes under UV-visible light irradiation,"A CdS photocatalyst was synthesized successfully at low temperature via a catalyst-free hydrothermal technique which is simple, green and also easily controlled. The synthesized CdS photocatalyst showed hexagonal wurtzite structure with high crystallinity and excellent optical properties. The catalyst was used for degradation of two anionic azo dyes namely reactive red (RR141) and Congo red (CR) azo dyes. The catalyst showed very high efficiency of 99.8% and 99.0% toward photodegradation of RR141 and CR dye, respectively. The photodegradation reaction followed pseudo-first order kinetics. Chemical scavenger studies showed that direct photogenerated hole transfer from CdS to the azo dye was most likely the major pathway for photodegradation of the azo dye. The chemical structure of the CdS photocatalyst remained stable after photodegradation. The CdS photocatalyst retains its original efficiency even after the fifth cycle of reuse indicating the advantages of stability and reusability. The CdS nanostructures will be suitable for removal of highly toxic and hazardous organic materials in environmental protection."
441691200002,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Hydrogeochemical behavior of uranium and thorium in rock and groundwater samples from southeastern of El Bajio Guanajuatese, Guanajuato, Mexico","To evaluate the hydrogeochemical processes related to the presence, mobility, and transport of uranium and thorium in the southeastern Sierra de Guanajuato of the Bajio Guanajuatense, Mexico, the concentration of these elements in volcanic rocks and in groundwater were determined. Acidic volcanic rocks contained uranium concentrations of 1.04-6.88 ppm and thorium concentrations of 3.13-15.58 ppm. A basalt rock sample contained 2.58 and 4.07 ppm of uranium and thorium, respectively, and an andesite rock sample contained 4.07 and 8.7 ppm of uranium and thorium, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed that U and Th are disseminated throughout the matrix of felsic rocks; in addition, phosphate minerals (probably monazite) containing both elements are present. The concentration of uranium in water samples ranged from 2.23 to 10.3 ppb and of thorium ranged from 0.33 to 0.39 ppb. Geochemical modeling indicated that uranium was mobilized through the transport of the uranyl ions (UO2 (2+)) and their complexes, especially carbonates, although other elements such as Fe, Mg, HCO3, and Ca could also be involved in the mobility and transportation of uranium. The obtained results suggest that the mobilization of thorium is very low, almost negligible in some cases, so this element did not present a quantifiable hydrogeochemical pattern. In spite of the low concentrations of U and Th, the existence of high radon concentrations in several samples indicates that additional radioactive species could be naturally present in the hydrogeological environment."

We enrolled postmenopausal women with recent DRF (n=57), HF (n=41), or CONT (n=93), and used impact microindentation to assess bone material strength index (BMSi) at the anterior surface of the mid-tibia diaphysis. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) (g/cm(2)) of the femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH), and lumbar spine (LS) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). HF and DRF subjects had significantly lower BMD than CONT at all sites (-5.6% to -8.2%, p<0.001 for all). BMSi was 4% lower in DRF compared to CONT (74.36 +/- 8.77 versus 77.41 +/- 8.79, p=0.04). BMSi was similarly lower in HF versus CONT, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (74.62 +/- 8.47 versus 77.41 +/- 8.79, p=0.09). Lower BMSi was associated with increased risk of DRF (unadjusted OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.00, per SD decrease, p=0.04), and remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, age and BMI, and age, BMI, and FN BMD (OR=1.48 to 1.55). Lower BMSi tended to be associated with HF, but only reached borderline significance (unadjusted OR=1.39; 95% CI, 0.96 to 2.01, p=0.08). These results provide strong rationale for future investigations aimed at assessing whether BMSi can predict fracture in prospective studies and improve identification of women at risk for fragility fractures.

In this paper, the characterization and functional analysis of a Toll9 receptor gene from Penaeus monodon was performed in HEK293T cells. Data showed that PmToll9 can activate the NF-kappa B promoter activities of TLR pathway, while ISRE and IFN-beta promoter cannot be activated obviously in HEK293T cells using dual-luciferase reporter system. The downstream immune factors of IL-8, I kappa Ba, and TRAF6 were activated by PmToll9 and IL-8 showed the most significant up-regulation in expression levels, indicating the activities of NF-KB can be mediated by PmToll9. Six LRRs-deletion mutants were constructed and results showed these mutants had obvious declines in luciferase activities, among which the mutant pCMV-DeLRR4 showed the most significant decline. qPCR data indicated LRRs-deletion mutants efficiently impaired the activities of the downstream immune factors IL-8, I kappa B-alpha, and TRAF6. It demonstrates that LRRs-deletion mutants could result in the weaken abilities of PmToll9 in signaling transduction. Overexpression of PmToll9-GFP fusion protein in Hela cells revealed the primary cellular localization of PmToll9 is in the cytoplasm."

First, the grayscale image is divided into a set of non-overlapping image blocks. Each block is represented by an input vector, and these input vectors are then sorted by Hotelling transform. Second, the ABC algorithm is employed to select some of the sorted vectors to form an initial codebook. Third, this codebook serves as the input of the LBG algorithm to compute vector quantization codebook. The experimental results show that the proposed HT-ABC-LBG algorithm outperforms the FF-LBG algorithm in terms of the quality of the decompressed image and the computation time."
423143500016,NATURE CHEMISTRY,Self-assembly of polyhedral metal-organic framework particles into three-dimensional ordered superstructures,"Self-assembly of particles into long-range, three-dimensional, ordered superstructures is crucial for the design of a variety of materials, including plasmonic sensing materials, energy or gas storage systems, catalysts and photonic crystals. Here, we have combined experimental and simulation data to show that truncated rhombic dodecahedral particles of the metal-organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8 can self-assemble into millimetre-sized superstructures with an underlying three-dimensional rhombohedral lattice that behave as photonic crystals. Those superstructures feature a photonic bandgap that can be tuned by controlling the size of the ZIF-8 particles and is also responsive to the adsorption of guest substances in the micropores of the ZIF-8 particles. In addition, superstructures with different lattices can also be assembled by tuning the truncation of ZIF-8 particles, or by using octahedral UiO-66 MOF particles instead. These well-ordered, submicrometre-sized superstructures might ultimately facilitate the design of three-dimensional photonic materials for applications in sensing."

Out of 81 S. aureus isolates 65 strains (80%) contained agr while 16 (20%) strains were non-typeable. Conclusions: In conclusion, biofilm production was observed for both agr positive and agr negative isolates. Furthermore, the presence of icaAD genes was not associated with all biofilm producing strains as some strains negative for icaAD genes displayed biofilm production."
428681600003,NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,Plasma-based wakefield accelerators as sources of axion-like particles,We estimate the average flux density of minimally-coupled axion-like particles (ALPs) generated by a laser-driven plasma wakefield propagating along a constant strong magnetic field. Our calculations suggest that a terrestrial source based on this approach could generate a pulse of ALPs whose flux density is comparable to that of solar ALPs at Earth. This mechanism is optimal for ALPs with mass in the range of interest of contemporary experiments designed to detect dark matter using microwave cavities.
435824500060,RSC ADVANCES,Degradation of tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate by a microwave enhanced heterogeneous Fenton process using iron oxide containing waste,"Iron oxide containing waste was first used in the microwave (MW) enhanced heterogeneous Fenton process for removing tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) in aqueous solution. The operational parameters that affect the removal efficiency were investigated in detail. Comparing with the traditional Fenton-like reaction and heating assisted Fenton-like reaction, the MW enhanced heterogeneous Fenton process displayed superior treatment efficiency. The iron ore tailing can be reused eight times without significant decrease of catalytic efficiency. The major intermediates were identified and the possible degradation pathways of TCEP were proposed. The acute toxicity gradually decreased during the degradation process and the removal of TOC was 98.8% after 35 min reaction. This study could not only apply the waste tailing as a secondary resource to avoid the tedious preparation of the catalyst, but also proposes a rapid, low-cost and effective alternative method for the removal of polluted water containing TCEP."

A brief history of the general problem of cracking in brazed stainless steel fuel injection lines places this failure in context. The fracture mechanism was likely to be fatigue due to vibrations. Other factors contributed to the failure, such as an inappropriate braze repair and incorrect bend radius and location dimensions. The effectiveness of current airworthiness directives and manufacturer service bulletins are discussed. Alternative designs are suggested to prevent recurrence."
454586900058,INTERNATIONAL FOOD RESEARCH JOURNAL,"Prediction of water content, sucrose and invert sugar of sugarcane using bioelectrical properties and artificial neural network","The study aimed to predict moisture content, sucrose and invert sugar of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) using artificial neural network (ANN) prediction model. The ANN model was developed based on the bioelectrical properties of the sugarcane. Bioelectrical properties were measured using LCR meter within 0.1 to 10 kHz range of frequency. The researchers then correlated the result of measurement with chemical content of sugarcane to develop an ANN prediction model. The best ANN topology (3-20-40-3) consisted of 3 nodes of input layer (inductance, capacitance and resistance), 20 nodes in hidden layer 1, 40 nodes in hidden layer 2 and 3 nodes of output layer (water content, sucrose and invert sugar) with training algorithm (trainlm), activation function of hidden layer (logsig), activation function of output layer (purefin), learning rate 0.1 and momentum 0.5. Based on the best topology, the researchers figured out that the validation of mean square error (MSE) was obtained at 0.0122. These results indicated that an ANN model based on the bioelectrical properties can be used to predict the chemical content of sugarcane. (C) All Rights Reserved"
448272500005,HUMAN GENETICS,De novo unbalanced translocations have a complex history/aetiology,"We investigated 52 cases of de novo unbalanced translocations, consisting in a terminally deleted or inverted-duplicated deleted (inv-dup del) 46th chromosome to which the distal portion of another chromosome or its opposite end was transposed. Array CGH, whole-genome sequencing, qPCR, FISH, and trio genotyping were applied. A biparental origin of the deletion and duplication was detected in 6 cases, whereas in 46, both imbalances have the same parental origin. Moreover, the duplicated region was of maternal origin in more than half of the cases, with 25% of them showing two maternal and one paternal haplotype. In all these cases, maternal age was increased. These findings indicate that the primary driver for the occurrence of the de novo unbalanced translocations is a maternal meiotic non-disjunction, followed by partial trisomy rescue of the supernumerary chromosome present in the trisomic zygote. In contrast, asymmetric breakage of a dicentric chromosome, originated either at the meiosis or postzygotically, in which the two resulting chromosomes, one being deleted and the other one inv-dup del, are repaired by telomere capture, appears at the basis of all inv-dup del translocations. Notably, this mechanism also fits with the origin of some simple translocations in which the duplicated region was of paternal origin. In all cases, the signature at the translocation junctions was that of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) rather than non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Our data imply that there is no risk of recurrence in the following pregnancies for any of the de novo unbalanced translocations we discuss here."
432296800002,SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE,Critical role of the right VLPFC in emotional regulation of social exclusion: a tDCS study,"There is abundant evidence suggesting that the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) plays an important role in down-regulating the emotional response to social exclusion. However, a causal relationship between rVLPFC function and explicit emotional regulation is not clear in the context of social exclusion. This study employed anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to activate rVLPFC while participants used emotional regulation to reappraise pictures of social exclusion. Forty-four participants were randomly assigned to an active tDCS group or a sham group. Both groups viewed social exclusion images under two conditions: in the no-reappraisal condition, participants were instructed to passively view social exclusion images; in the reappraisal condition, they reappraised the images to down-regulate negative emotional responses. Compared to sham stimulation, anodal tDCS over the rVLPFC resulted in less negative emotion ratings, and produced significantly smaller pupil diameter in the reappraisal, compared to no-reappraisal block. The tDCS also led to longer fixation durations to rejectees and shorter fixation durations to rejecters. Taken together, these findings suggest a causal role for rVLPFC in down-regulation of negative emotions produced by social exclusion. This study has implications for clinical interventions targeting emotional regulation deficits."
418189600003,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS,A Journalists' Protest? Personal Identification and Journalistic Activism in the Israel Social Justice Protest Movement,"The Social Justice Protest movement in 2011 was the largest social movement in Israel's history. The movement received media coverage for almost two months and in all news outlets, despite the protest's broad demands and its overall radical indictment against the economic system and the status quo. This study explores the causes for this extraordinary media coverage. We find that movement characteristics of the leadership's professional background, the media strategies they employed, and the effects of mainstream channels on media tactics were important. We also find that journalists' personal identification with the movement is a key factor leading to the wide and favorable media coverage. Personal identification led many journalists to report favorably on the movement and write supportive opinion columns, to ignore stories that could damage it, to participate and volunteer in movement activities, and to offer their professional skills to help the movement leadership. We propose a tentative model consisting of factors and mechanisms that may explain when personal identification and journalistic activism are more likely to occur."
439297800012,TOBACCO CONTROL,Tobacco price boards as a promotional strategy-a longitudinal observational study in Australian retailers,"Background Price boards in tobacco retailers are one of the few forms of tobacco promotion remaining in Australia. This study aimed to examine how these boards were used to promote products over a period of rapidly rising taxes. Methods Observations were made in a panel of 350 stores in Melbourne, Australia, in November of 2013 (just before) and in 2014 and 2015 (after 12.5% increases in tobacco duty). Fieldworkers unobtrusively noted the presence and characteristics of price boards, and the brand name, size and price of the product at the top of each board. Results Price boards were common in all store types apart from newsagent/lottery agents. The characteristics of the top-listed product changed notably over time: premium brands accounted for 66% of top-listed products in 2013, significantly declining to 43% in 2015, while packs of 20 cigarettes increased in prominence from 32% to 45%. The prevalence of packs of 20 cigarettes in budget market segments tripled from 2013 (13%) and 2014 (11%) to 32% in 2015, with no change in the proportion of packs that were under $A20 from 2014 (37%) to 2015 (36%). The rate of increase in the average price of the top-listed pack correspondingly flattened from 2014 to 2015 compared with 2013-2014. Conclusions Price boards promote tobacco products in ways that undermine the effectiveness of tax policy as a means of discouraging consumption. Communication to consumers about prices should be restricted to information sheets provided to adult smokers on request at the point of sale."
439878200006,JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT,Genetic structure in Elk persists after translocation,"Elk (Cervus canadensis) translocation success is thought to be facilitated by high post-release herd cohesion and limited movements; both should ensure genetic mixing following release. Such mixing is important to reduce potential effects of inbreeding or genetic drift, which can be especially important in small founding populations. We had a natural experiment where we could evaluate genetic mixing of 2 distinct lineages of elk after translocation to the same area. Founding elk ultimately came from north and south of a road barrier at Elk Island National Park (EINPN or EINPS, respectively), Alberta, Canada and the 2 groups were genetically distinct. During 2000 to 2003, elk originating from Elk Island National Park were translocated to Cumberland Mountains, Tennessee (TNCM) and Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina (GSMNP), USA (some elk spent time at Land Between the Lakes Recreation Area, Kentucky, USA, before their final translocation). At TNCM, translocated elk were hard released, whereas at GSMNP elk were held in pens up to 60 days before release (i.e., soft release). We hypothesized that associations formed in the source population would affect genetic structure in the future population. We predicted that matrilineal groups would stay closer together and have similar movements after translocation. We used 16 microsatellite markers to analyze genetic composition and structure of translocated elk and their offspring in the years after release. Most source elk used for translocation strongly assigned to either EINPN or EINPS (93.2%, n=204). Evaluating the genetic structure of offspring after translocation, we found the 2 genetic groups mostly persisted 11 years following release. We measured the Euclidean distance between all possible pairs of telemetered female elk during each season and year and calculated the maximum distance moved from the release sites for females surviving >1 year. Mean Euclidean distances between pairwise locations of female elk were similar for each genetic cluster for each area. The mean distances for all paired locations (genetic clusters combined) in TNCM were 14.67km (n=4,57613.23 [SD]) and in GSMNP were 9.30km (n=1,468 +/- 9.75). However, when looking at only simultaneous locations <50m apart, the frequency of occurrence was higher (P<0.001) for elk with the same genetic structure (71.1%) compared with those with different structure (28.9%). The maximum distance travelled from the release site was not different for the 2 genetic groups, but EINPN females tended to travel farther. Pairwise female distances were lower in GSMNP where we used a soft release. Release methodology and social structure appear to affect movements and possibly genetic mixing after translocation. Given that restoration success can depend on maintaining genetic diversity and number of founders, our analyses suggest that within-cluster breeding bias can result in lower genetic variability and a smaller effective population size than previously assumed.

423468700001,BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES,Portable low-power thermal cycler with dual thin-film Pt heaters for a polymeric PCR chip,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been widely used for major definite diagnostic tool, but very limited its place used only indoor such as hospital or diagnosis lab. For the rapid on-site detection of pathogen in an outdoor environment, a low-power cordless polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycler is crucial module. At this point of view, we proposed a low-power PCR thermal cycler that could be operated in an outdoor anywhere. The disposable PCR chip was made of a polymeric (PI/PET) film to reduce the thermal mass. A dual arrangement of the Pt heaters, which were positioned on the top and bottom of the PCR chip, improved the temperature uniformity. The temperature sensor, which was made of the same material as the heater, utilized the temperature dependence of the Pt resistor to ensure simple fabrication of the temperature sensor. Cooling the PCR chip using dual blower fans enabled thermal cycling to operate with a lower power than that of a Peltier element with a high power consumption. The PCR components were electrically connected to a control module that could be operated with a Li-ion battery (12 V), and the PCR conditions (temperature, time, cycle, etc.) were inputted on a touch screen. For 30 PCR cycles, the accumulated power consumption of heating and cooling was 7.3 Wh, which is easily available from a compact battery. Escherichia coli genomic DNA (510 bp) was amplified using the proposed PCR thermal cycler and the disposable PCR chip. A similar DNA amplification capability was confirmed using the proposed portable and low-power thermal cycler compared with a conventional thermal cycler."
444007500003,IEICE ELECTRONICS EXPRESS,Multi-band multi-mode end-fire antenna based on mirroring and scaling method,"One multi-functional antenna with multi-band multi-mode property based on mirroring and scaling method (MSM) is proposed in this letter. The design procession could be divided into three steps: firstly, one former periodic end-fire antenna with bowtie dipoles is mirrored on the same substrate; then the mirrored part is scaled into about two thirds of the original size; finally, parameters are optimized for fine tuning target. This antenna has three different radiation modes at three different bands respectively, i.e. one +y directional mode in the lower band, one -y directional mode in the higher band and one bidirectional mode along both +/- y direction in-between the two bands. Both the field distribution and parameter analysis are given to explore the working principle. One prototype is fabricated for verification. With the advantages of planar structure, wide bandwidth and radiation pattern selectivity, the proposed antenna has a potential application in wireless communication system in the future."
426107000007,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM,mTORC1/rpS6 regulates blood-testis barrier dynamics and spermatogenetic function in the testis in vivo,"The blood-testis barrier (BTB), conferred by Sertoli cells in the mammalian testis, is an important ultrastructure that supports spermatogenesis. Studies using animal models have shown that a disruption of the BTB leads to meiotic arrest, causing defects in spermatogenesis and male infertility. To better understand the regulation of BTB dynamics, we report findings herein to understand the role of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), a downstream signaling protein of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), in promoting BTB disruption in the testis in vivo, making the barrier ""leaky."" Overexpression of wild-type rpS6 (rpS6-WT, the full-length cDNA cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo) and a constitutively active quadruple phosphomimetic mutant cloned into pCI-neo (p-rpS6-MT) vs. control (empty pCI-neo vector) was achieved by transfecting adult rat testes with the corresponding plasmid DNA using a Polyplus in vivo-jetPEI transfection reagent. On the basis of an in vivo functional BTB integrity assay, p-rpS6-MT was found to induce BTB disruption better than rpS6-WT did (and no effects in empty vector control), leading to defects in spermatogenesis, including loss of spermatid polarity and failure in the transport of cells (e.g., spermatids) and organelles (e.g., phagosomes), to be followed by germ exfoliation. More important, rpS6-WT and p-rpS6-MT exert their disruptive effects through changes in the organization of actin-and microtubule (MT)-based cytoskeletons, which are mediated by changes in the spatiotemporal expression of actin-and MT-based binding and regulatory proteins. In short, mTORC1/rpS6 signaling complex is a regulator of spermatogenesis and BTB by modulating the organization of the actin-and MT-based cytoskeletons."
450159700024,OPTICS LETTERS,NDR-effect vertical-illumination-type Ge-on-Si avalanche photodetector,"We present the enhanced performances of a verticalillumination-type Ge-on-Si avalanche photodetector based on internal RF-gain effects operating up to 50 Gb/s. A fabricated Ge-on-Si avalanche photodetector (APD) exhibits three operational voltage regions associated with different aspects of the current (DC) gain and bandwidth characteristics. The measured current-voltage (I-V) curve of a Geon-Si APD exhibits a negative photoconductance (negative differential resistance [NDR]) in a high bias region beyond the avalanche breakdown voltage (V-br), where a device shows good eye openings up to 50 Gb/s (non-return-to-zero [NRZ] signal) with further improved signal-to-noise ratios and signal amplitudes. A ROSA packaged module, wherein a fabricated Ge-on-Si APD is wire-bonded to a commercial TIA with a similar to 75% optical alignment for lambda similar to 1310 nm and biased at a lower voltage than the V-br, exhibits the sensitivities of -18.9 and -15.3 dBm for 30 and 35 Gb/s, respectively, and -13.9 dBm for 40 Gb/s at a 10(-12) bit error rate. The experimental results indicate that considerable improvement in a module performance can be expected by utilizing the Ge-on-Si APD operated in the NDR region with a properly customized TIA.

The sample consisted of 11,794 high school students (M-age = 16, SD = 1.23; female assigned at birth = 51%; 1.8% identified as transgender) across 23 schools. Participants completed a self-report survey that assessed sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender identity, victimization experiences (e.g., peer and dating), perceptions of school violence and crime, as well as anxiety and suicidality. Multilevel analyses indicated that lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, and transgender (LGBTQ) individuals with lower rates of victimization had significantly lower rates of suicidality compared to LGBTQ individuals with higher rates of victimization. LGBTQ individuals in schools with high student perceptions of school violence and crime had higher suicidality than their non-LGBTQ counterparts. LGBTQ youth in schools with lower school violence and crime levels had lower rates of suicidality than their non-LGBTQ counterparts. Interventions need to consider multiple forms of victimization and school environment as potential risk and protective factors for LGBTQ youth."
437381100004,BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS,Dual-core all-fiber integrated immunosensor for detection of protein antigens,"An optical fiber interferometric microprobe for detection of specific proteins is presented in this paper. The microprobe is an all-fiber device, which is based on Michelson interferometer configuration, which allows for detection of protein antigens in an analyzed solution thanks to antibodies immobilized on the sensor surface. The interferometer is made of dual core fiber and has a precisely formed arm length difference, achieved by splicing a fragment of polarization maintaining fiber to one of the cores. An all-fiber configuration of the sensor decreases substantially cross-sensitivities to temperature and deformation in comparison to other optical fiber interferometers. Reported sensor has a sensing region on the tip of the interferometer and therefore may be used for point measurements in medicine. The immunosensor and optical measuring system are designed to utilize the most common broadband light sources that operate at a central wavelength of 1.55 mu m. The results show that it is possible to detect a protein antigen present in a solution by using an all-fiber interferometer coated with specific antibodies. The resulting peak shift can reaches 0.6 nm, which is sufficient to be measured by an optical spectrum analyzer or a spectrometer. A model allowing for estimation of the value of lower limit of detection for such sensors has been elaborated. The elaborated detection system may act as a framework for detection of various antigens and thus it can find future applications in medical diagnostics."

Special attention was devoted to the preparation of the TiO2-based catalysts, since this oxide has been widely used for catalytic and photocatalytic application in alcohol oxidation reactions. Thus, in the catalytic process, the colloidal heterocoagulation of very stable sols, followed by the spray-freeze-drying (SFD) approach, was successfully applied for the preparation of nanostructured porous TiO2-SiO2 mixed-oxides with high surface areas. The versatility of the process made it possible to encapsulate Pt particles and use this material in the liquid-phase oxidation of HMF. The photocatalytic activity of a commercial titania and a homemade oxide prepared with the microemulsion technique was then compared. The influence of gold, base addition, and oxygen content on product distribution in the photocatalytic process was evaluated."

Territory, Politics, Governance. Australia and New Zealand's historically close cultural and economic ties have deepened since the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s. This paper develops an exploratory account of an emerging form of Antipodean territoriality that contributes another exemplar to interpretations of how public authority and private interests coalesce in the governance of space. Drawing on publicly available empirical material on contemporary migration and financial flows across the Tasman Sea and concepts from assemblage thinking, it is argued that these flows are stabilized through different institutional adjustments and enmeshments with cultural norms in both territories. Australian banks now supply financial capital to undergird a property (real estate) boom in New Zealand, the profits from which are returned to Australia. Concurrently, there has been mass migration of New Zealand citizens to Australia facilitated by the Special Category Visa, who are in turn replaced by mass migration into New Zealand. This research reveals how Australian-located power and interests exert a, albeit fragile and mutable, spatial reach into New Zealand territorial space to regulate, at a distance, migration into Australia while simultaneously legitimating the logics of financial extraction."
432643700022,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW,An improved image processing technique for determination of volume and surface area of rising bubble,"Bubble volume and bubble surface area are key parameters that affect the working performance of bubble columns. Due to their non-intrusive characteristics and high spatial resolution, image processing techniques can be used to measure bubble volume. However, bubbles in practical application are not always perfectly spherical or ellipsoidal. In homogenous flow regimes where bubble interaction is weak, the bubble geometry can be classified into three types: round cap, ellipsoidal, and disk-shaped. For large and severely distorted bubbles, it is difficult to employ existing image processing methods for measuring the bubble volume. This study describes an image analysis technique that was developed to obtain the volume and surface area of large and severely deformed bubbles. This proposed image processing method is based on a differential segmentation concept and possesses better adaptability because it considers both the bubble geometry and deflection angle of the bubble. The developed image processing technique is verified using the results of a bubble collection experiment. By making use of the developed image processing algorithm, the volume and surface area of discrete bubbles have been calculated. The relationship between bubble volume distribution and gas flow rate is discussed and the characteristics of bubble surface area variance are shown. Moreover, the influences of bubble volume and surface area on the bubble rise velocity are analyzed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The main purpose of this paper is to compute the corrections to the mass of the field due to the presence of the compactified dimensions. Although the results of the one-loop correction to the mass of a lambda phi(4) field are very well known for compactified toroidal spaces, where the field obeys periodic boundary conditions, similar results do not appear to be readily available for cases in which the scalar field is subject to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

In seeking to escape from an abusive relationship and provide for her family, she turned to her knowledge of native foods and love of wild harvesting' from her childhood, to develop a thriving business. Her traditional knowledge of harvesting native foods has now led to the creation of products such as lemon myrtle sweet chilli sauce, Davidson plum syrup and cosmetics using ingredients such as Kakadu plum, emu oil, lemon myrtle and wild berry. Sharon now finds herself in a position where increased opportunities for international expansion are demanding increased volume and scale from her rural operations, where she works with Indigenous communities. She faces three key challenges about the future of Indigiearth: 1. How can Indigiearth achieve scale while maintaining profitability and social mission? 2. How can Indigiearth protect its competitive advantage in the face of increased local agricultural competition, as Indigenous crops increase in value? 3. How can traditional knowledge be both shared and protected for community development (jobs and wealth creation) and for future generations? The New Year is close and Sharon already has received large orders coming in from Europe and there is much interest from China and Japan. These decisions will determine how Indigiearth is structured, with whom it needs to partner to develop the Indigenous food industry, and how it will need to work with stakeholders on the issue of traditional knowledge while meeting the growing needs of the company. Sharon has a passion for her native products and wants to preserve the knowledge and respect that goes into her products - the dilemmas she is facing are putting her under immense pressure. She may choose to expand while maintaining the integrity of her business - but how can this be done?"

It is unknown whether Sierra Leonean women with such condition use herbal medicine. This study investigates the prevalence and factors associated with herbal medicine use among women seeking care for infertility. This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted among women seeking care for infertility at various clinics within Freetown, Sierra Leone. Data analysis included Chi-square tests and logistic regression. Out of the 167 women that participated, 36.5% used herbal-medicine for infertility treatment. Women with no formal (AOR 4.03, CL: 1.38-11.76, p = 0.011), primary education (AOR: 6.23, CL: 2.02-19.23, p = 0.001) and those that visited a traditional medicine practitioner (AOR: 20.05, CL: 2.10-192.28, p = 0.009) as well as women suffering from other reproductive health problems (AOR: 2.57, CL: 1.13-5.83, p = 0.024) were more likely to use herbal medicines. Friends and family (n = 57, 96.7%) were the main influencers of herbal medicine use. Only (n = 12) 19.7% of users disclosed their status to their healthcare provider. Over half (n = 32, 52.5%) could not remember the name of the herb they used. Luffa acutangula (n = 29, 100%) was the herbal medicinal plant users could recall. Herbal medicine use among women seeking care for infertility in Freetown is common. Healthcare providers should be aware of the potential dyadic use of herbal and allopathic medicines by their patients and be knowledgeable about commonly used herbal remedies as well as being proactive in communicating the potential risks and benefits associated with their use."

Considering the asymmetric PAs, the authors propose an antenna shuffling method with 1-bit feedback to improve the power efficiency (PE) of the STBC system. Numerical results verify that the proposed A-STBC system with 1-bit feedback antenna shuffling achieves a better PE-and-rate tradeoff and the potential ability of the small amount of feedback information for the power efficient systems."
438679100014,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Incineration of Nanoclay Composites Leads to Byproducts with Reduced Cellular Reactivity,"Addition of nanoclays into a polymer matrix leads to nanocomposites with enhanced properties to be used in plastics for food packaging applications. Because of the plastics' high stored energy value, such nanocomposites make good candidates for disposal via municipal solid waste plants. However, upon disposal, increased concerns related to nanocomposites' byproducts potential toxicity arise, especially considering that such byproducts could escape disposal filters to cause inhalation hazards. Herein, we investigated the effects that byproducts of a polymer polylactic acid-based nanocomposite containing a functionalized montmorillonite nanoclay (Cloisite 30B) could pose to human lung epithelial cells, used as a model for inhalation exposure. Analysis showed that the byproducts induced toxic responses, including reductions in cellular viability, changes in cellular morphology, and cytoskeletal alterations, however only at high doses of exposure. The degree of dispersion of nanoclays in the polymer matrix appeared to influence the material characteristics, degradation, and ultimately toxicity. With toxicity of the byproduct occurring at high doses, safety protocols should be considered, along with deleterious effects investigations to thus help aid in safer, yet still effective products and disposal strategies."
446427600017,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,"Altitudinal migration: ecological drivers, knowledge gaps, and conservation implications","Animal migration has been the subject of intensive research for more than a century, but most research has focused on long-distance rather than short-distance migration. Altitudinal migration is a form of short-distance migration in which individuals perform seasonal elevational movements. Despite its geographic and taxonomic ubiquity, there is relatively little information about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence altitudinal migratory behaviour. Without this information, it is difficult to predict how rapid environmental changes will affect population viability of altitudinal migrants. To synthesize current knowledge, we compiled literature on altitudinal migration for all studied taxa, and identified the leading hypotheses explaining this behaviour. Studies of animal altitudinal migration cover many taxonomic lineages, with birds being the most commonly studied group. Altitudinal migration occurs in all continents except for Antarctica, but about a third of the literature focused on altitudinal migration in North America. Most research suggests that food and weather are the primary extrinsic drivers of altitudinal migration. In addition, substantial individual-level variation in migratory propensity exists. Individual characteristics that are associated with sex, dominance rank, and body size explain much of the variation in migratory propensity in partially migratory populations, but individual-level correlates are poorly known for most taxa. More research is needed to quantify the effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and climate change on altitudinal migrants. Demographic studies of individually marked populations would be particularly valuable for advancing knowledge of the cascading effects of environmental change on migratory propensity, movement patterns, and population viability. We conclude our review with recommendations for study designs and modelling approaches that could be used to narrow existing knowledge gaps, which currently hinder effective conservation of altitudinal migratory species."
451598900476,SENSORS,Evaluation of Strategies for the Development of Efficient Code for Raspberry Pi Devices,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is faced with challenges that require green solutions and energy-efficient paradigms. Architectures (such as ARM) have evolved significantly in recent years, with improvements to processor efficiency, essential for always-on devices, as a focal point. However, as far as software is concerned, few approaches analyse the advantages of writing efficient code when programming IoT devices. Therefore, this proposal aims to improve source code optimization to achieve better execution times. In addition, the importance of various techniques for writing efficient code for Raspberry Pi devices is analysed, with the objective of increasing execution speed. A complete set of tests have been developed exclusively for analysing and measuring the improvements achieved when applying each of these techniques. This will raise awareness of the significant impact the recommended techniques can have."
441783700004,ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS,Estimating the open biomass burning emissions in central and eastern China from 2003 to 2015 based on satellite observation,"Open biomass burning (OBB) has significant impacts on air pollution, climate change and potential human health. OBB has gathered wide attention but with little focus on the annual variation of pollutant emission. Central and eastern China (CEC) is one of the most polluted regions in China. This study aims to provide a state-of-the-art estimation of the pollutant emissions from OBB in CEC from 2003 to 2015, by adopting the satellite observation dataset - the burned area product (MCD64Al) and the active fire product (MCD14 ML) - along with local biomass data (updated biomass loading data and high-resolution vegetation data) and local emission factors. The successful adoption of the double satellite dataset for long-term estimation of pollutants from OBB with a high spatial resolution can support the assessing of OBB on regional air quality, especially for harvest periods or dry seasons. It is also useful to evaluate the effects of annual OBB management policies in different regions. Here, monthly emissions of pollutants were estimated and allocated into a 1 x 1 km spatial grid for four types of OBB including grassland, shrubland, forest and cropland. From 2003 to 2015, the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning had an annual fluctuation, whereas the emissions from crop straw burning steadily increased. The cumulative emissions of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), methane (CH4), nitric oxide (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and fine particles (PM2.5) were 3.64 x 10(3), 2.87 x 10(2), 3.05 x 10(3), 1.82 x 10(3), 6.4 x 10(3), 2.12 x 10(2), 4.67 x 10(2), 4.59 x 10(4), 9.39 x 10(5) and 4.13 x 10(3) Gg in these years, respectively. Crop straw burning was the largest contributor for all pollutant emissions, by 84 %-96 %. For the forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning, forest fire burning emissions contributed the most, and emissions from grassland fire were negligible due to little grass coverage in this region. High pollutant emissions concentrated in the connection area of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui, with emission intensity higher than 100 tons per square kilometer, which was related to the frequent agricultural activities in these regions. Peak emission of pollutants occurred during summer and autumn harvest periods including May, June, September and October, during which similar to 50% of the total pollutant emissions were emitted in these months. This study highlights the importance of controlling the crop straw burning emissions. From December to March, the crop residue burning emissions decreased, while the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland exhibited their highest values, leading to another small peak in emissions of pollutants. Obvious regional differences in seasonal variations of OBB were observed due to different local biomass types and environmental conditions. Rural population, agricultural output, economic levels, local burning habits, social customs and management policies were all influencing factors for OBB emissions."
453253300051,ARCHIVES OF METALLURGY AND MATERIALS,MICROSTRUCTURE AND COMPRESSION PROPERTIES OF Fe-Cr-B ALLOY MANUFACTURED USING LASER METAL DEPOSITION,"Fe-Cr-B alloy is a material with precipitation of boride inside Fe matrix, and it features outstanding hardness and wear resistance properties. However, Fe-Cr-B alloy is a difficult material to process, making it difficult to use as a bulk type structure material which requires delicate shapes. This study attempted to manufacture Fe-Cr-B alloy using a 3D printing process, laser metal deposition. This study also investigated the microstructure, hardness and compression properties of the manufactured alloy. Phase analysis results is confirmed that alpha-Fe phase as matrix and (Cr, Fe)(2)B phase as reinforcement phase. In the case of (Cr, Fe)(2)B phase, differences were observed according to the sample location. While long, coarse, unidirectional needle-type boride phases (similar to 11 mu m thickness) were observed in the center area of the sample, relatively finer boride phases (similar to 6 mu m thickness) in random directions were observed in other areas. At room temperature compression test results confirmed that the sample had a compression strength is approximately 2.1 GPa, proving that the sample is a material with extremely high strength. Observation of the compression fracture surface identified intergranular fractures in areas with needle-type boride, and transgranular fractures in areas with random borides. Based on this results, this study also reviewed the deformation behavior of LMD Fe-Cr-B alloy in relation to its microstructures."
449045600023,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,Diazotroph community structure and the role of nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen cycle in the Chukchi Sea (western Arctic Ocean),"Marine nitrogen fixation occurs not only in subtropical and tropical regions but also in colder regions. However, the distribution of diazotrophs, nitrogen fixation rate, and its contribution to the nitrogen cycle in the Arctic Ocean remain poorly understood. We examined the diazotroph community structure and activity in the shelf and off-shelf regions of the Chukchi Sea, western Arctic Ocean, during late summer 2015. The nitrate and ammonium assimilation rates were determined simultaneously to gain insights into the role of nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen cycle of the region. The diazotroph community determined by Illumina sequencing was mainly composed of Cluster III nifH phylotypes (putative anaerobes), accounting for>80% of the total sequences examined, except for one surface sample. This result is strikingly different from previous findings in other oceanic regions. The nifH sequences other than those from Cluster III were mostly affiliated with UCYN-A2 (symbiotic cyanobacteria), which accounted for<15% of the total sequences. UCYN-A2 tended to be abundant (maximum 2.9 x 10(3) copies L-1) in the high-temperature low-salinity water mass that is characteristic of Pacific-originating water. Nitrogen fixation rate was detectable at most stations, with a range of 0.08-3.60 nmol L-1 d(-1), displaying no clear relationship with depth (light intensity) or nitrate or ammonium concentration. Nitrogen fixation locally exceeded nitrate assimilation, but accounted for 1.00% at most in the total nitrogen assimilation in the euphotic zone."
444922500003,CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY,A new criterion for detection of radiculopathy based on motor evoked potentials and intraoperative nerve root monitoring,"Objective: Our objective is to use the area of the motor evoked potential (MEP) as a diagnostic tool for intraoperative radicular injury. Methods: We analyzed the intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring data and clinical outcomes of 203 patients treated for dorsolumbar spine deformity. The decrease in amplitude was compared with the reduction in the MEP area. Results: In 11 cases, new intraoperative injuries occurred, nine of them were lumbar radiculopathies. Our new criteria, a decrease MEP area of 70%, yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 1, since it detected all the radicular injuries, with no false positive cases. Using a 70% amplitude decrease criteria, we obtained a sensitivity of 0,89 and a specificity of 0,99. A lower threshold (65% amplitude reduction) yielded a higher number of false positives, whereas a higher threshold (75 and 80%) gave rise to a higher number of false negatives. Conclusions: The measurement of the MEP area gave evidence to be more reliable and accurate than the measurement of the amplitude reduction in order to assess and detect intraoperative radicular injuries. Significance: The criterion of decrease of the MEP area has a higher reliability and accuracy in the detection of intraoperative radicular lesions than the amplitude reduction.

431462000010,GRANULAR MATTER,3D experimental quantification of fabric and fabric evolution of sheared granular materials using synchrotron micro-computed tomography,"Many experimental studies have demonstrated that mechanical response of granular materials is highly influenced by microstructural fabric and its evolution. In the current literature, quantification of fabric and its evolution has been developed based on micro-structural observations using Discrete Element Method or 2D experiments with simple particle shapes. The emergence of X-ray computed tomography technique has made quantification of such experimental micro-structural properties possible using 3D high-resolution images. In this paper, synchrotron micro-computed tomography was used to acquire 3D images during in-situ conventional triaxial compression experiments on granular materials with different morphologies. 3D images were processed to quantify fabric and its evolution based on experimental measurements of contact normal vectors between particles. Overall, the directional distribution of contact normals exhibited the highest degree of isotropy at initial state (i.e., zero global axial strain). As compression progressed, contact normals evolved in the direction of loading until reaching a constant fabric when experiments approached the critical state condition. Further assessment of the influence of confining pressure, initial density state, and particle-level morphology on fabric and its evolution was formed. Results show that initial density state and applied confining pressure significantly influence the fabric-induced internal anisotropy of tested specimens at initial states. Relatively, a higher applied confining pressure and a looser initial density state resulted in a higher degree of fabric-induced internal anisotropy. Influence of particle-level morphology was also found to be significant particularly on fabric evolution."

445054400017,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS,Accelerating the protection schemes through IEC 61850 protocols,"IEC61850 protocols aim to reduce the data management with a bandwidth that does not present any issues. Fast tripping protection schemes using IEC 61850 will lead to network flooding, high delay, and reduced network security. The study provides propagation characteristics of traveling wave with extra high-speed busbar protection in compliance with IEC 61850 technique. This paper analyzes the process bus and suggests two methods in order to achieve the intended fast protection with IEC 61850. The simulation of the suggested methods based on the OPNET Modeler has proven that these methods can solve the network flooding problem in Ethernet and band-limited channels such as WLAN. This study will pave the way for researchers to reuse the traveling waves for fast protection with IEC 61850. In this paper, the simulation results of the case study busbar protection using transient signal (traveling wave) based on IEC 61850 network system configurations using OPNET Modeler simulation software were presented and the influence of data rate, a number of MUs sharing process bus and delay characteristics of these system configurations were evaluated."
439125400001,ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES,"Clinical, biochemical and genetic spectrum of 70 patients with ACAD9 deficiency: is riboflavin supplementation effective?","Background: Mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 9 (ACAD9) is essential for the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. Disease causing biallelic variants in ACAD9 have been reported in individuals presenting with lactic acidosis and cardiomyopathy. Results: We describe the genetic, clinical and biochemical findings in a cohort of 70 patients, of whom 29 previously unpublished. We found 34 known and 18 previously unreported variants in ACAD9. No patients harbored biallelic loss of function mutations, indicating that this combination is unlikely to be compatible with life. Causal pathogenic variants were distributed throughout the entire gene, and there was no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation. Most of the patients presented in the first year of life. For this subgroup the survival was poor (50% not surviving the first 2 years) comparing to patients with a later presentation (more than 90% surviving 10 years). The most common clinical findings were cardiomyopathy (85%), muscular weakness (75%) and exercise intolerance (72%). Interestingly, severe intellectual deficits were only reported in one patient and severe developmental delays in four patients. More than 70% of the patients were able to perform the same activities of daily living when compared to peers. Conclusions: Our data show that riboflavin treatment improves complex I activity in the majority of patient-derived fibroblasts tested. This effect was also reported for most of the treated patients and is mirrored in the survival data. In the patient group with disease-onset below 1 year of age, we observed a statistically-significant better survival for patients treated with riboflavin."
447112600084,CHEMOSPHERE,Black water collected from the septic tank treated with a living machine system: HRT effect and microbial community structure,"In this study, the performance of a living machine (LM) system was evaluated for use in the treatment of black water collected from septic tanks with hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 6, 5, and 4 days. We found that the HRT had little effect on the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, the removal rates of total nitrogen (TN) and ammonium nitrogen (NHZ-N) decreased with the reduction of HRT, whereas the removal efficiency of total phosphate (TP) was consistently low because of the long sludge retention time. The working conditions of #1 achieved the highest removal efficiency of COD (85%), NH4+-N (75%), and TN (47%), although the removal efficiency of TP (11%) was slightly lower than that of #2 (12%). The microbial communities in each tank of the LM system were characterized by high-throughput sequencing, which showed that the LM system successfully created more favorable conditions for fermentative bacteria than traditional systems, with relative abundances of 13% (#1), 13% (#2), and 15% (#3) compared to that of the anaerobic/anoxic/oxic (A(2)O) system (<3%). Smithella was the dominant fermentative bacteria, accounting for 9% (#1), 7% (#2), and 10% (#3) of total bacteria in the LM system. The relative abundances of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (12%) and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) (7%) in the LM system were much higher than that in the A(2)O system. Overall, the LM system offered a more sustainable and economical solution for treating black water. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The results are fairly robust: all our moving average lags produce about 36% (34%) less Value-at-Risk and about 31% (30%) less expected shortfall without giving up any returns on average after transaction costs compared to the buy-and-hold strategy, calculated in local currencies (in U.S. dollars). In addition, the paper finds that the volatility of returns follows a similar pattern by producing on average 29% (30%) less volatility in local currencies (in U.S. dollars). Moreover, the CAPM betas of the trading rule are significantly lower (50%) than in the buy-and-hold strategy."
452058700001,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Selective Metaphor Impairments After Left, Not Right, Hemisphere Injury","The relative contributions of the left and right hemispheres to the processing of metaphoric language remains unresolved. Neuropsychological studies of brain-injured patients have motivated the hypothesis that the right hemisphere plays a critical role in understanding metaphors. However, the data are inconsistent and the hypothesis is not well-supported by neuroimaging research. To address this ambiguity about the right hemisphere's role, we administered a metaphor sentence comprehension task to 20 left-hemisphere injured patients, 20 right hemisphere injured patients, and 20 healthy controls. Stimuli consisted of metaphors of three different types: predicate metaphors based on action verbs, nominal metaphors based on event nouns, and nominal metaphors based on entity nouns. For each metaphor (n = 60), a closely matched literal sentence with the same source term was also generated. Each sentence was followed by four adjective-noun answer choices (target + three foil types) and participants were instructed to select the phrase that best matched the meaning of the sentence. As a group, both left and right hemisphere patients performed worse on metaphoric than literal sentences, and the degree of this difficulty varied for the different types of metaphor-but there was no difference between the two patient groups. Tests for literal-metaphor dissociations at the level of single cases revealed two types of impairments: general comprehension deficits affecting metaphors and literal sentences equally, and selective metaphor impairments that were specific to different types of metaphor. All cases with selective metaphor deficits had injury to the left hemisphere, and no known comprehension difficulties with literal language. Our results argue against the hypothesis of a specific or necessary contribution of the right hemisphere for understanding metaphoric language. Further, they reveal deficits in metaphoric language comprehension not captured by traditional language assessments, suggesting overlooked communication difficulties in left hemisphere patients."
442754000002,SILICON,Pongamia Pinnata as a Green Corrosion Inhibitor for Mild Steel in 1N Sulfuric Acid Medium,"Due to the harmful nature of the traditional inhibitors, in recent years researchers have an interest in using eco-friendly corrosion inhibitors. The plant extracts exhibit efficient corrosion inhibition properties due to the presence of a mixture of organic constituents starting from terpenoids to flavonoids. In the present study the inhibition of corrosion of mild steel in 1N H2SO4 solution using the leaf extract of Pongamia pinnata (P. pinnata) was investigated by the weight loss method, potentiodynamic polarization method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. Characterization of the leaf extract of P. pinnata was carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis. The effect of temperature and immersion time on the corrosion behavior of mild steel in sulfuric acid with different concentrations of P. pinnata was also studied. From the results it was found that the inhibition is mainly attributed to the adsorption of inhibitor molecules on the mild steel electrode surface. It was found that the adsorption of inhibitor molecules takes place according to the Langmuir, Temkin, and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. Kinetic as well as thermodynamic parameters were calculated, also confirming the strong interaction between inhibitor molecules and the electrode surface. The inhibition efficiency (I.E in %) was found to increase with increase in concentration of the inhibitor molecules and the maximum inhibition efficiency was attained at 100 ppm of the leaf extract. From the electrochemical studies it was found that the corrosion process was controlled by a mixed inhibition process and single charge transfer mechanism Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provided the confirmatory evidence for the adsorption of the extract molecules on the mild steel surface, which is responsible for the corrosion inhibition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) experiments also confirmed the presence of inhibitor molecules on the mild steel surface. From all these experimental results, it can be concluded that the leaf extract of P. pinnata acted as a good corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in 1N sulfuric acid medium even at lower inhibitor concentrations."
443088000018,CELL DEATH & DISEASE,Human menstrual blood-derived stem cells promote functional recovery in a rat spinal cord hemisection model,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with a dismal prognosis including severe voluntary motor and sensory deficits in the presence of the current therapies, thus new and efficient treatment strategies are desperately required. Along with several advantages, such as easy accessibility, high-yield, potential of enormous proliferation, menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MenSCs) have been proposed as a promising strategy in regeneration medicine. In this study, the MenSCs were transplanted into incomplete thoracic (T10) spinal cord injury (SCI) rats, all rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, and 28 days after surgery. Based on the results, we found that MenSCs transplantation improved the hind limb motor function. Besides, H&E staining showed that MenSCs treatment markedly reduced cavity formation in the lesion site. Furthermore, treatment by MenSCs showed more MAP2-positive mature neurons, as well as axonal regeneration manifested by NF 200 and less expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) than the non treatment in the lesion site. Additionally, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and qRT-PCR methods showed that levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were significantly higher in the injured spinal cord after implantation of MenSCs. Results of qRT-PCR indicated that inflammatory factors, including TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta were inhibited after MenSCs transplantation. The improved motor function of hind limb and the increased cell body area of motor neurons were suppressed by blocking of the BDNF-TrkB signaling. It was eventually revealed that MenSCs implantation had beneficial therapeutic effects on the rehabilitation of the rat spinal cord hemisection model, mainly by enhancing the expression of BDNF. MenSCs transplantation may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with SCI in the future."

We conducted an online survey to collect data on skin manifestations due to supplement use in consumers and to identify the suspected products and ingredients. An online survey was conducted among 63,737 dietary supplement users in 2016. Those who self-reported experiences of skin anthema or itching caused by supplement use and recognized a causal relationship as almost certain (0.8%) were invited to provide further details of symptoms and products. Most of the users experienced mild symptoms with ""itching and/or rash of body part."" After the onset of skin manifestations, 69.3% ceased supplement use, while 26.6% continued supplement use, including those who reduced the amount or frequency of use. Respondents who visited the hospital in response to symptoms accounted for 26.0%, while 53.3% did not seek treatment. The products used were identified in 155 of 300 eligible respondents. Although those products were composed of multiple ingredients, the accumulated data suggested that cutaneous symptoms were related to the following constituents: ""Peptides or animal by-products"" (31.0%), ""Herbal/Botanical"" (23.2%) and ""Fats and lipid"" (13.5%). Conducting an online survey to elicit information directly from consumers identified components of supplements that are involved in skin manifestations that could lead to serious damage, and may fill a void in the current adverse event reporting system."
444291700001,PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC,Automatic Detection of Sunspots on Full-disk Solar Images Using the Simulated Annealing Genetic Method,"Sunspots with strong magnetic fields are the most important manifestations of solar activity, appearing as dark features in the photosphere observed in continuum images. We proposed an artificial intelligence technology called the simulated annealing genetic (SAG) method, which combined the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to self-adaptively derive dual thresholds for detecting the umbra and penumbra of sunspots simultaneously. Full-disk continuum intensity images obtained from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) at a cadence of four hours from 2010 May to 2016 December were used. The detection results showed that the dual thresholds derived by the SAG method have outstanding performance in segmenting the umbra and penumbra from the photosphere with a satisfactory robustness efficiently. The boundaries of the umbra and penumbra were finely delineated, even for sunspots at the extreme solar limb. The total sunspot areas, umbral areas, and penumbral areas match very well with the data reported from HMI Debrecen Data (HMIDD), with the correlation coefficients reaching 0.99, 0.99, and 0.95, respectively. The mean ratios of umbra to sunspot areas per year ranged from 0.159 to 0.233. The ratios decreased with an increase in solar activity, which implies that the ratio was related to the solar activity level."

Aiming at solving the problem of counting-loss generated by eliminating distorted pulses, this paper proposes an improved method of pulse repairing. A Pu-238 source with activity of 10mCi was used as the measurement object, and the energy spectrum obtained by the pulse repairing method was compared with that obtained by the pulse elimination method. The ten-measurement results show that the pulse repairing method can correct the counting-loss caused by the pulse elimination method and increase peak area, which is of great significance for obtaining a precise X-ray energy spectrum."

In this study, indoor dust samples were collected and sieved into 6 size fractions (i.e., <43 mu m, 43-63 mu m, 63-100 mu m, 100-150 mu m, 150-200 mu m, and 200-2000 mu m). Ingestion bioaccessibility of PAHs was measured by physiologically based extraction test. Bioaccessibility in fractions of 200-2000 mu m was generally higher than those in other particle sizes. Daily uptake doses based on benzo(a) pyrene toxic equivalency quantity were 1.09-15.0 ng/d/kg, and peaked at fractions of < 43 mu m, while doses considering bioaccessibility ranged from 0.02 to 0.21 ng/d/kg, and peaked at fractions with relatively larger particle size. Cell toxicity was also investigated by human normal liver cell line viability through exposure to organic extracts of indoor dust fractions with various particle sizes. Our results indicated that it is crucial to consider dust particle size and bioaccessibility during risk assessment."
452945000011,JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,Paleo-cold seep activity in the southern South China Sea: Evidence from the geochemical and geophysical records of sediments,"Over the past decade more than 30 cold seep sites have been reported along the continental slope of the South China Sea (SCS). These seep sites have all been located in the northern SCS, and no methane seepage has been discovered in the southern SCS. Here, we report on the analysis results of the geochemical and geophysical of the marine core sediments (58S) collected from the southern continental slope of the SCS. We suggest that the sedimentary total sulfur (TS), total inorganic carbon (TIC), delta S-34(CRs) values of chromium reducible sulfur (CRS) and carbonate delta C-13(TIC) values of the bulk sediments, coupled with the ratio of (NRMAF60mT-NRMAF80mT)/NRM can be used to trace the methane release events in a methane-rich environment. At least two methane release events were identified at depths of 5.5-6.2 m and 6.8-7.2 m. Moreover, according to the characteristic of the TS/TOC and (NRMAF60mT-NRMAF80mT)/NFtM ratio of sediments, we suggest the methane flux has changed episodically. This inference is supported by the occurrence of the strongly negative carbonate delta C-13(TiC) values of bulk sediments and the positive delta S-34(CRS) values, which indicate the occurrence of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and the location of a past or present sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ), respectively. Ultimately, these new data suggest that the combined geochemical and geophysical study of marine sediments provides a valuable tool with which to infer the temporal variations in methane seepage in a marine environment."

Therefore, early diagnosis of SEP is crucial and may avoid life-threatening situation.Case presentation:A 29-year-old G3P2 woman presented with 50 days of amenorrhea and positive serum -human gonadotropin (-HCG) was enrolled into the hospital due to the absence of gestational sac located in the uterine cavity. A pan-abdominal ultrasound scan revealed a 2.6cm x1.6cm hyperechoic mass inferior to the spleen with color Doppler signal surrounding and 0.9cm anechoic inside. The gynecologist found the gestational sac was located in the dorsal pole of the spleen through the exploratory laparoscopy. Total splenectomy was performed uneventfully to avoid the hemorrhage shock.

The current study presents a novel approach to quantify Des and Isodes using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) in a linear ion trap coupled to a vacuum MALDI source. MALDI-MS2 analyses of Des and Isodes are performed using stable-isotope-labeled desmosine d(4) (labeled-Des) as an internal standard in different biological fluids, such as urine and serum. The method demonstrated linearity over two orders of magnitude with a detection limit of 0.02ng/L in both urine and serum without enrichment prior to mass spectrometry, and relative standard deviation of <5%. The method is used to evaluate the time-dependent degradation of Des upon UV irradiation (254nm) and found to be consistent with quantification by H-1 NMR. This is the first characterized MALDI-MS2 method for quantification of Des and Isodes and illustrates the potential of MALDI-ion trap MS2 for effective quantification of biomolecules. The reported method represents improvement over current liquid chromatography-based methods with respect to analysis time and solvent consumption, while maintaining similar analytical characteristics."

428322500042,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS,Image forgery detection using region - based Rotation invariant Co-occurrences among adjacent LBPs,"Today's Image processing tools have matured to a level where its users can effortlessly modify or enhance the images according to their requirement. A misuse of such tools has created a necessity for authenticating images to ensure its correctness. Image Forensics deals with the study of different kinds of manipulation on images and their detection. Image forgery detection algorithms detect forgery related artifacts which can be distinguished using specific image properties. Texture-based features have been widely used to detect forgery induced texture variations in the images. In this paper, we propose Region and Texture combined features for Image Forgery Detection. The Region-based approaches like-Edge-based Region Detection, Saliency-based Region Detection, andWavelet-based Region Detection are captured, and on these regions, the texture feature-Rotation invariant Co-occurrences among adjacent LBP (RiCoLBP) is applied. The features thus obtained are optimized using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization and fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The method is extensively evaluated on three benchmark datasets for image forgery detection namely CASIA v1.0, CASIA v2.0 and CUISDE. The performance reveals improved detection accuracies when compared to the state-of-the-art methods in detecting forged and authentic images."
445911300005,LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW,About the civil union in Chile: for a feminist and queer jurisprudence,"In Chile, a bill recognizing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples was signed into law in April 2015. In this article, we analyze the parliamentary debate on the civil union's law and the role of law professors invited as experts in the debate. We conclude that their position as experts was marginal inside and outside the Congress. As a result, the parliament approved the law with several shortcomings. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, we propose that intraprofessional battles over expertise are a crucial factor to understand better the formulation of gender and sexual policies in Latin America. Second, from an interdisciplinary approach, we propose to reimagine family law decoupled from norms centered on dyadic and romantic relationships and oriented to procreation."

In this work, through high field de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillation studies, we have found evidence for the predicted topological nontrivial bands in ZrSnTe. Furthermore, from the angular dependence of quantum oscillation frequency, we have revealed the three-dimensional Fermi surface topologies of this layered material owing to strong interlayer coupling."
444597000007,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Synthesizing exceptional points with three resonators,"In non-Hermitian coupled-resonator networks, the eigenvectors of degenerate eigenmodes may become parallel due to the singularity at so-called exceptional points (EP). To exploit the extraordinary parametric sensitivity at EPs, an important problem is, given an arbitrary set of resonators, how to generate a desired EP by properly coupling them together. This paper provides the solution for the case of three resonators. We show that all physically admissible EPs can be realized with either weakly coupled linear networks or strongly coupled circular networks, and the latter type of EPs has not been reported in the literature. Each admissible EP eigenvalue is associated with two and only two resonator-network realizations, and the formulas for calculating the required coupling constants are provided. The characteristics of these EPs are illustrated by the sharp change of transmission spectra near them, which verifies the enhanced sensitivity induced by the singularity of EPs. The obtained results lay a basis for designing EP structures towards broader applications."

Infusions were stored at room temperature (20 degrees C-24 degrees C) with or without exposure to natural light or refrigerated (4 degrees C-8 degrees C) and protected from light up to 2 weeks. In the initial solution of 2 MU CMS in 100 mL saline sampled immediately after reconstitution and dilution, 1.5% of CMS was hydrolysed to colistin. When stored at room temperature and exposed to natural light, colistin concentration in elastomeric infusion pumps increased to 2.6% in 8 days and to 2.1% when stored at 4 degrees C. CMS stability increases at lower temperatures and higher concentrations. Based on the current data, chemical stability of CMS infusion solution is sufficient for a shelf life of 7 days refrigerated plus 1 day at room temperature."

Here, we used a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene to identify sand fly species in Maranhao State (northeastern Brazil) and to assess cryptic diversity occurring at different spatial scales. For this, we obtained 148 COI sequences of 15 sand fly species (10 genera) from Maranhao (fine spatial scale), and joined them to COI sequences from other Brazilian localities (distant about 2,000 km from Maranhao, broad spatial scale) available in GenBank. We revealed cases of cryptic diversity in sand flies both at fine (Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz and Neiva) and Evandromyia termitophila (Martins, Falcao and Silva)) and broad spatial scales (Migonemyia migonei (Franca), Pressatia choti (Floch and Abonnenc), Psychodopygus davisi (Root), Sciopemyia sordellii (Shannon and Del Ponte), and Bichromomyia flaviscutellata (Mangabeira)). We argue that in the case of Bi. flaviscutellata, the cryptic diversity is associated with a putative new species. Cases in which DNA taxonomy was not as effective as morphological identification possibly involved recent speciation and/or introgressive hybridization, highlighting the need for integrative approaches to identify some sand fly species. Finally, we provide the first barcode sequences for four species (Brumptomyia avellari (Costa Lima), Evandromyia infraspinosa (Mangabeira), Evandromyia evandroi (Costa Lima and Antunes), and Psychodopygus complexus (Mangabeira)), which will be useful for further molecular identification of neotropical species."

The median survival time of patients with MM is only 5 years, with patients frequently experiencing relapse. Currently, there is no effective therapy for recurrent MM. The results of the present study indicated that pyrvinium pamoate (PP), a US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral anthelmintic drug, exhibited potent antitumor activity in MM cells in vitro. It is demonstrated that PP inhibited MM cell proliferation and mediated apoptosis. Notably, PP markedly promoted the degradation of beta-catenin and abrogated its phosphorylation. PP triggered apoptosis in MM cells by inducing the release of cytochrome c and downregulating the expression of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein. In addition, PP effectively induced cell death in primary MM cells. In conclusion, PP may be a promising agent for the clinical treatment of MM."
423485500003,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS,Fate and exposure modeling in regulatory chemical evaluation: new directions from retrospection,"The development and application of fate and exposure modeling has undergone fundamental changes over the last 20 years. This has, in part, been driven by different needs within the regulatory community to address chemicals of concern using different approaches. Here we present a retrospective look at fate and exposure model application over the last two decades keeping an international regulatory perspective and using the Government of Canada's Chemicals Management Plan to illustrate concepts. We discuss the important role fate and exposure modeling has played to help address key data gaps when evaluating the risk of chemicals for both human health and ecological reasons. Yet limitations for more widespread model application within a regulatory context remain. Consequently, we identify specific data gaps and regulatory needs with an eye towards new directions for 21st century chemical evaluation. We suggest that one factor limiting greater model application is the need for increased awareness and agreement of what chemical exposure assessment encompasses within the risk assessment paradigm. This is of particular importance today because of the increased availability of computational and high-throughput data and methods for chemical assessment allowing evaluators to potentially examine exposure from site of release to site of toxic action, thus linking exposure with toxicology. We further suggest there is a need for discussion at a global level to promote the awareness of new tools and approaches available for fate and exposure modeling and suggest that this could be organized using the aggregate exposure pathways concept. Environmental significance The evaluation of chemical impacts is often challenged by the lack of empirically measured multimedia processes that contribute to exposures in human and non-human receptors. Fate and exposure models play a key role in helping decision-makers fill data gaps to better characterize these exposures and thus determine the risk potential of chemicals in the environment. This article takes a retrospective look at the regulatory application of environmental models that have or can be used to assist the characterization of exposures in human and ecological receptors while providing some insights on new directions for modeling within 21st century risk assessment."
415929600006,JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS,Simultaneous edit-imputation and disclosure limitation for business establishment data,"Business establishment microdata typically are required to satisfy agency-specified edit rules, such as balance equations and linear inequalities. Inevitably some establishments' reported data violate the edit rules. Statistical agencies correct faulty values using a process known as edit-imputation. Business establishment data also must be heavily redacted before being shared with the public; indeed, confidentiality concerns lead many agencies not to share establishment microdata as unrestricted access files. When microdata must be heavily redacted, one approach is to create synthetic data, as done in the U.S. Longitudinal Business Database and the German IAB Establishment Panel. This article presents the first implementation of a fully integrated approach to edit-imputation and data synthesis. We illustrate the approach on data from the U.S.Census of Manufactures and present a variety of evaluations of the utility of the synthetic data. The paper also presents assessments of disclosure risks for several intruder attacks. We find that the synthetic data preserve important distributional features from the post-editing confidential microdata, and have low risks for the various attacks."
439782100001,COMPLEXITY,Adaptive Barrier Control for Nonlinear Servomechanisms with Friction Compensation,"This paper proposes an adaptive barrier controller for servomechanisms with friction compensation. A modified LuGre model is used to capture friction dynamics of servomechanisms. This model is incorporated into an augmented neural network (NN) to account for the unknown nonlinearities. Moreover, a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is utilized to each step in a backstepping design procedure. Then, a novel adaptive control method is well suggested to ensure that the full-state constraints are within the given boundary. The stability of the closed-loop control system is proved using Lyapunov stability theory. Comparative experiments on a turntable servomechanism confirm the effectiveness of the devised control method."
445141400008,ATMOSPHERE,Seasonal Variation of Aerosol Size Distribution Data at the Puy de Dome Station with Emphasis on the Boundary Layer/Free Troposphere Segregation,"Aerosol particles are important due to their direct and indirect impacts on climate. Within the planetary boundary layer (BL), these particles have a relatively short lifetime due to their frequent removal process by wet deposition. When aerosols are transported into the free troposphere (FT), their atmospheric lifetime increases significantly, making them representative of large spatial areas. In this work, we use a combination of in situ measurements performed at the high altitude PUY (Puy de Dome, 45 degrees 46' N, 2 degrees 57' E, 1465 m a.s.l) station, together with LIDAR profiles at Clermont-Ferrand for characterizing FT conditions, and further characterize the physical properties of aerosol in this poorly documented area of the atmosphere. First, a combination of four criteria was used to identify whether the PUY station lies within the FT or within the BL. Results show that the PUY station is located in BL with frequencies ranging from 50% during the winter, up to 97% during the summer. Then, the classification is applied to a year-long dataset (2015) of particle size distribution data to study the differences in particle physical characteristics (size distribution) and black carbon (BC) concentrations between the FT and the BL. Although BC, Aitken, and the accumulation mode particles concentrations were higher in the BL than in the FT in winter and autumn, they were measured to be higher in the FT compared to BL in spring. No significant difference between the BL and the FT concentrations was observed for the nucleation mode particles for all seasons, suggesting a continuous additional source of nucleation mode particles in the FT during winter and autumn. Coarse mode particle concentrations were found higher in the FT than in the BL for all seasons and especially during summer. This indicates an efficient long-range transport of large particles in the FT from distant sources (marine and desert) due to higher wind speeds in the FT compared to BL. For FT air masses, we used 204-h air mass back-trajectories combined with boundary layer height estimations from ECMWF ERA-Interim to assess the time they spent in the FT since their last contact with the BL and to evaluate the impact of this parameter on the aerosol properties. We observed that even after 75 h without any contact with the BL, FT aerosols preserve specific properties of their air mass type."

Cells of strain B093034(T) were oxidase-negative and catalase-positive. Growth was observed at 4-41 degrees C, at pH 4.5-10.0 and at 0-7% (w/v) NaCl. The isolate contained Q-10 as the predominant isoprenoid quinone, summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 7c and/or C-18:1 omega 6c), C-16:0 and C(14:0)2-OH as the major fatty acids, sym-homospermidine as the major polyamine, and sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, aminolipid, two unidentified phospholipids and three unidentified polar lipids as the polar lipids. The DNA G+C content was 67.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain B093034(T) grouped with members of the genus Sphingomonas and was closely related to Sphingomonas sanguinis IFO 13937(T) (96.49% similarity), Sphingomonas pseudosanguinis G1-2(T) (96.37 %), Sphingomonas ginsenosidimutans Gsoil 1429(T) (95.99 %) and Sphingomonas endophytica YIM 65583(T) (95.78 %). On the basis of the polyphasic evidence presented here, strain B093034(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas aeria sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is B093034(T) (=CFCC 13949(T)=LMG 30133(T))."
425985900011,JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,Alkali halides based on nano-alumina as positive and negative ion source for ion mobility and mass spectrometry,"In this work, a new long-life alkali ion source is proposed that is based on alkali halide salts doped in nano-gamma-alumina (Al2O3). Depending on the polarity, the ion source produces both alkali and halide ions. The source was characterized using different techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). SEM images confirm a strong interaction between the alkali halide (MX) and nano-gamma-alumina. The average particle size of the doped nanoparticles was calculated to be 44 nm by TEM. Formation of new phases (KAlCl2O and K3AlF6) was confirmed by XRD and that of Al-O-K group in the synthesized particles by FT-IR. Alkali and halide ion peaks were observed by IMS in the positive and negative modes, respectively. The lifetime of the ion source for different alkali halides was measured to range from 216 to 960 h. The total ion current emitted from the source was about 2 A mu A, while it was 12 nA at the collector plate of the IMS. Finally, application of the new source in ion mobility spectrometry was demonstrated by observing ion mobility spectra of compounds ionized via cation and anion attachment reaction."
424397600238,ENERGIES,Frequency Regulation of a Hybrid Wind-Hydro Power Plant in an Isolated Power System,"Currently, some small islands with high wind potential are trying to reduce the environmental and economic impact of fossil fuels by using renewable resources. Nevertheless, the characteristics of these renewable resources negatively affect the quality of the electrical energy, causing frequency disturbances, especially in isolated systems. In this study, the combined contribution to frequency regulation of variable speed wind turbines (VSWT) and a pump storage hydropower plant (PSHP) is analyzed. Different control strategies, using the kinetic energy stored in the VSWT, are studied: inertial, proportional, and their combination. In general, the gains of the VSWT controller for interconnected systems proposed in the literature are not adequate for isolated systems. Therefore, a methodology to adjust the controllers, based on exhaustive searches, is proposed for each of the control strategies. The control strategies and methodology have been applied to a hybrid wind-hydro power plant on El Hierro Island in the Canary archipelago. At present, in this isolated power system, frequency regulation is only provided by the PSHP and diesel generators. The improvements in the quality of frequency regulation, including the VSWT contribution, have been proven based on simulating different events related to wind speed, or variations in the power demand."

This formulation is more convenient than the one given in Roscani and Santillan (Fract. Calc. Appl. Anal., 16, No 4 (2013), 802-815) and Tarzia and Ceretani (Fract. Calc. Appl. Anal., 20, No 2 (2017), 399-421), because it allows us to work with Green's identities (which does not apply when Caputo derivatives are considered). As a main result, an integral relationship between the temperature and the free boundary is obtained which is equivalent to the fractional Stefan condition. Moreover, an exact solution of similarity type expressed in terms of Wright functions is also given."

440778600092,PLOS ONE,behavioral study on tonal working memory in musicians and non-musicians,"Tonal working memory (WM) refers to the maintenance and the online manipulation of tonal information and has been suggested to involve different mechanisms than verbal WM. Previous research has suggested that verbal WM performance is determined by the duration instead of the number of verbal materials. We investigated in the present study to what degree that the number and the duration of notes in a sequence influence the tonal WM in participants with or without professional musical training. The forward tonal discrimination task in Experiment 1 tested the maintenance of the tonal information and the backward Nback tonal task in Experiment 2 probed the running memory span of tonal information. Results show that the number of notes, but not the duration of notes in a tone sequence significantly affects tonal WM performance for both musicians and non-musicians. In addition, within a minimum musical context, musicians outperformed non-musicians in the N-back tonal task but not the forward tone sequence discrimination task. These findings indicate that the capacity of tonal WM is determined by the number of notes but not the duration of notes in a sequence to be memorized, suggesting a different mechanism underlying tonal WM from verbal WM. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that N-back tonal task is a quantitative and sensitive measure of the effect of musical training on tonal WM."

However, until now the most investigated polyHIPEs are hydrophobic composites originating from synthetic polymers. Here we present an investigation of a hierarchical porous protein scaffold templated from oil-in-water (O/W) HIPEs costabilized by fully natural materials, gelatin, and gelatin nanoparticles. Fairly monodispersed gelatin nanoparticles were first synthesized through a two-step desolvation method, and then they were used as emulsifiers together with gelatin to fabricate stable HIPEs with adjustable droplet size distribution and rheology. Monolithic scaffolds were formed by cross-linking the HIPEs with polymers as low as 2.5 wt % in the continuous phase, which appropriately presented a general high porosity and had an interconnected porous morphology with smooth pore walls and textured structures. Furthermore, the scaffolds were degradable and showed reasonably good biocompatibility; L929 cells could adhere to the surface of the materials and exhibited intensive growth and well-spread morphology. This hierarchical porous protein scaffold could, therefore, have important application as a 3D scaffold that offers enhanced cell adhesion and functionality."

We compared self-injurers with non-self-injurers, and current with past self-injurers. Self-injurers experienced more family Expressed Emotion (EE) than non-injurers (t(254) = -3.24, p = 0.001), linear contrasts explaining 6% of between-groups variability (F(2, 254) = 7.36, p = 0.001, (2) = 0.06). Differences in EE between current and past self-injurers were not significant. Overall shame accounted for 33% of between-groups variance (F(2, 252) = 61.99, p < 0.001, (2) = 0.33), with linear contrasts indicating self-injurers experienced higher levels compared to non-injurers (t(252) = -8.23, p < 0.001). Current self-injurers reported higher overall shame than past self-injurers (t(252) = 6.78, p < 0.001). In further logistic regression, emotional involvement and overall shame were the only significant predictors of self-injury status. With every one-unit increase in emotional involvement, odds of currently engaging in self-injury decreased by a factor of 0.860. Conversely, a one-unit increase in overall shame was associated with an increase in the odds of being a current self-injurer by a factor of 1.05. The findings have important treatment implications for engaging key family members in intervention and prevention efforts."

The dietary carbohydrate balance index (CBI) was expressed as the ratio of physically effective neutral detergent fibre (g/kg of DM) to rumen degradable starch (g/kg of DM). Twenty-four Chinese Holstein heifers aged similar to 8 months were randomly divided into four groups of six. The length and content of Chinese wild-rye hay and the content of rumen degradable starch in diets were used to adjust dietary CBI, and treatment diets consisted of the following four CBI levels: 1.21 (Treatment A), 1.53 (Treatment B), 1.86 (Treatment C) and 2.29 (Treatment D). The feeding trial lasted 75 days, with 15 days for adaptation. DM intake of heifers was not influenced by different treatments (P > 0.10). Average daily gain of heifers varied (0.86 +/- 0.10, 1.03 +/- 0.06, 1.12 +/- 0.08 and 0.98 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- s.d.) kg/day among groups respectively), with significant (P < 0.05) differences among treatments, but the initial and final bodyweight of heifers were not different (P > 0.10). In addition, the abdominal girth of heifers in Treatments C and D was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than that in Treatment A. With the increment of CBI, eating and chewing time increased significantly (P < 0.05), while eating frequency decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Rumen fluid pH increased significantly (P < 0.05) with the increasing of CBI level, while there was little difference in total volatile fatty acid concentration, and propionate, butyrate and valerate concentrations. Acetate concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in Treatments C and D than in Treatment A. Moreover, ammonia-nitrogen concentration of Treatments B and C was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of Treatment D. These results indicated that 1.86 is the optimal CBI in diets for 8-10-month-old heifers in the present study."
432998200004,ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS,A comparison of the momentum budget in reanalysis datasets during sudden stratospheric warming events,"The agreement between reanalysis datasets, in terms of the zonal-mean momentum budget, is evaluated during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events. It is revealed that there is a good agreement among datasets in the lower stratosphere and troposphere concerning zonal-mean zonal wind, but less so in the upper stratosphere. Forcing terms of the momentum equation are also relatively similar in the lower atmosphere, but their uncertainties are typically larger than uncertainties of the zonal-wind tendency. Similar to zonal-wind tendency, the agreement among forcing terms is degraded in the upper stratosphere. Discrepancies among reanalyses increase during the onset of SSW events, a period characterized by unusually large fluxes of planetary-scale waves from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and decrease substantially after the onset. While the largest uncertainties in the resolved terms of the momentum budget are found in the Coriolis torque, momentum flux convergence also presents a non-negligible spread among the reanalyses. Such a spread is reduced in the latest reanalysis products, decreasing the uncertainty of the momentum budget. It is also found that the uncertainties in the Coriolis torque depend on the strength of SSW events: the SSW events that exhibit the most intense deceleration of zonal-mean zonal wind are subject to larger discrepancies among reanalyses. These uncertainties in stratospheric circulation, however, are not communicated to the troposphere."
425075500012,CHEMOSPHERE,"Degradation of the UV-filter benzophenone-3 in aqueous solution using persulfate activated by heat, metal ions and light","The goals of this study were to bring forward new data and insights into the effect of activation methods, operational variables and reaction pathways during sulfate radicals-based oxidation of benzophenone-3 (BP-3) in aqueous solution. Heat, transition metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Co2+), UV and visible light irradiation were used to activate persulfate (PS) to degrade BP-3. The results showed that these three activation methods can remarkably enhance BP-3 removal efficiency. Under the conditions of [BP-3](0): [PS](0) = 1: 500, pH = 7.0, and 40 degrees C, complete removal of BP-3 (131 mu M) was observed in 3 h. In the pH range of 3.0 - 9.0, the degradation of BP-3 decreased with increasing pH. Increasing the PS dosage accelerated the reaction, while the presence of humic acid (HA) significantly inhibited the efficiency of BP-3 removal. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching studies, sulfate and hydroxyl radicals contributed to the oxidation process. According to the evolution of BP-3 and its 7 by-products, as well as frontier electron densities (FED) calculation, two routes were proposed involving hydroxylation, demethylation and direct oxidation. On the whole, this work is a unique contribution to the systematic elucidation of BP-3 removal by PS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The adsorption on hybrid sorbents were characterized using FTIR, SEM with EDAX, TGA, DSC, and XRD analysis. Oil treated sorbents indicated the significant change owing to oil adsorption by both the sorbents. The experimental results showed that the sorption capacity significantly altered by pH as it plays a vital role in oil sorption process. At equilibrium, the maximum oil removal of 92% and 74% were achieved for 4% initial oil concentration using CS/LZMO and CS/AZMO, respectively. The regression coefficient values of Langmuir isotherm clearly indicate that it is best fit for oil sorption. Nature of oil sorption was found to be endothermic and spontaneous, confirmed by thermodynamic studies at different temperature. POLYM. COMPOS., 39:E261-E270, 2018.

432382800040,ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION,Inversion of Configuration at the Phosphorus Nucleophile in the Diastereoselective and Enantioselective Synthesis of P-Stereogenic syn-Phosphiranes from Chiral Epoxides,"Nucleophilic substitution results in inversion of configuration at the electrophilic carbon center (S(N)2) or racemization (S(N)1). The stereochemistry of the nucleophile is rarely considered, but phosphines, which have a high barrier to pyramidal inversion, attack electrophiles with retention of configuration at P. Surprisingly, cyclization of bifunctional secondary phosphine alkyl tosylates proceeded under mild conditions with inversion of configuration at the nucleophile to yield P-stereogenic syn-phosphiranes. DFT studies suggested that the novel stereochemistry results from acid-promoted tosylate dissociation to yield an intermediate phosphenium-bridged cation, which undergoes syn-selective cyclization."
427767200120,MATERIALS,The Preparation of TiO2 Film by the Sol-Gel Method and Evaluation of Its Self-Cleaning Property,"TiO2 sol was produced by the sol-gel method through the hydrolysis and the aging of tetrabutyl titanate and the TiO2 film was obtained by dipping and uniform lifting of the acid-treated and ultrasound-treated clean glass slides into the TiO2 sol followed by aging, drying, and calcination. The effect of the hydrolysis control agents to the formed sol was researched and the crystalline state, the morphology, and the photocatalytic properties of the products after calcination were characterized. The structural morphology, the contact angles before and after illumination, and the self-cleaning properties of the TiO2 film were characterized as well. The results showed that by using acetylacetone as the hydrolysis control agent, the formed TiO2 sol had relatively high stability. The product after the calcination of the TiO2 sol was of single anatase type with crystalline size of 18-20 nm and it could degrade nearly 100% of methylene blue after 90 min illumination. The formed TiO2 film is compact, continuous, smooth, and had the properties of super-hydrophilicity (after 30 min illumination due to its contact angle decreasing from 21 degrees to nearly 0 degrees) and anti-fogging capability, which indicated its excellent self-cleaning property."

Partial sequences of mitochondrial 16S (68 specimens) and COI (24 specimens) genes were analyzed. Phylogenetic trees and network analyses revealed three lineages and five sub-lineages of A. loveni. Genetic distance and AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance) analyses suggested that the lineages should be considered three cryptic species. Skin on the aboral disc is partly thickened and forms a mesh-like pattern, which has never been reported in previous descriptions of Asteronyx; this is provided as a new taxonomic character. Based on absence/presence of mesh-like skin, one of the three lineages was assigned to A. loveni and another was described as Asteronyx reticulata new species. This new species can be distinguished from congeners by having mesh-like skin and small genital slits at the innermost position on the interradial oral disc. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

450377200030,COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING,An integrated approach for the energy-efficient driving strategy optimization of multiple trains by considering regenerative braking,"With the rapid development of urban rail transit networks, the energy consumption problem of urban rail trains becomes more and more prominent. A critical issue is to reduce the energy consumption of trains through advanced control and optimization techniques. The majority of existing studies in this field focus on (1) the optimization of single train operation strategy and (2) the scheduling of multiple trains, separately. In this paper, we propose an integrated energy-efficient operation optimization method for multiple trains in multiple inter stations by considering regenerative braking. In particular, this paper integrates the energy-efficient operation strategy with optimized train timetable under the operation scenario of two trains in multiple interstations. First, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the energy-efficient operation strategy for single train in multiple interstations and obtain the relationship between the operation time and operation energy consumption of trains. Then, a particle swarm optimization method is adopted to obtain the optimal operation time of trains (i.e. train timetable) for the purpose of minimizing the overall energy consumption. Finally, real-world case studies based on the operation data of the Beijing subway line 7 are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach by optimizing the train operation strategy and timetable can reduce the total energy consumption by 16.24% compared with the real-world train operation strategy."
427577400025,JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY,Children with nocturnal enuresis and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A separate entity?,"Introduction There is ongoing debate about whether nocturnal enuresis (NE) is affected by the presence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Clarifying this relationship could categorize them as a separate entity, potentially requiring a different management from enuretic children without ADHD. Aims To study whether (1) children with ADHD exhibited greater severity of enuresis and associated voiding symptoms compared with children without ADHD, (2) whether there was a difference in enuretic response to treatment between children with/without ADHD, (3) whether previously prescribed medication for ADHD affected severity of enuresis or voiding symptoms, and response to treatment. Methods Data on all consecutive children seen with primary NE and ADHD and age-and gender-matched children with NE without ADHD over the course of 2 years were extracted from our database. Controls were identified using a random number generator to choose patients within each age/gender group. Changes in Dysfunctional Voiding Scoring System (DVSS) and Bristol scores were assessed before and after treatment for NE using repeated measures ANOVAs. Number of weekly wet nights was compared between the groups before and after the treatment of enuresis. Children with more than a 50% decrease in number of wet nights per week were categorized as responding to treatment. Results Compared with controls, ADHD children (N = 95) had significantly more severe voiding symptoms, NE and constipation (Table). No significant differences were found between children on ADHD medication (63.2%) and those who were not on ADHD medication (36.8%) on any of the demographic and pre-treatment clinical parameters. Similar enuretic response rates to behavioral modification alone were seen in both study (13.5%) and control (12.8%) groups (p = 0.73). Response to pharmacological treatment was seen in nine patients with ADHD (42.9%) and in six (20.7%) controls, with pharmacological intervention being significantly more effective than behavioral modification for patients with ADHD (p = 0.012). Additionally, no difference was found between ADHD patients on and off ADHD medication in terms of response to enuresis treatment. Conclusion In children with primary NE, the presence of ADHD was associated with more severe NE, voiding symptoms and constipation. The severity of voiding symptoms and/or NE was unrelated to the use of stimulant medication. The response to behavioral modification was comparable in both groups. However, patients with ADHD were significantly more responsive to medication for NE compared with behavioral modification, indicating a possible benefit for earlier pharmacological treatment for enuresis in this population subgroup."

Different reaction conditions were examined and optimized. A series of benzimidazolones derivatives were synthesized using NMP as solvent at 413K with excellent yields (80-94%). Various substrates were employed and the results suggested the wide application of our method. The quantum mechanics calculations demonstrated that the complexation of DBU with sulfur significantly enhanced the reaction. This protocol rovides a novel approach of fixing CO2 at atmospheric pressure into a series of 2-benzimidazolones derivates.
453024600006,PEDIATRIC ANNALS,Percent Body Fat Measurement in the Medical Management of Children with Obesity,"Sustaining weight loss can be challenging, as physiological responses to weight loss, including metabolic and hormonal adaptations and decreased energy expenditure, promote weight regain. Paired with sustained dietary changes, physical activity can promote weight maintenance after successful weight loss, as physical activity can help maintain fat-free mass. We present several illustrative cases to highlight the potential use of body composition measurement using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) scale to augment obesity management counseling in a tertiary care pediatric weight-management clinic. BIA does require some interpretation, as it can be affected by hydration status and time of day, as well as patient age, sex, and body mass index. Nonetheless, BIA can be a helpful aid to obesity counseling. More research is needed to better understand how to use change in percent body fat over time as a motivational tool for management of children with obesity."
430491300006,ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY-A JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ULTRASOUND AND ALLIED TECHNIQUES,Utilizing transesophageal echocardiography for placement of pulmonary artery catheters,"Objective: Pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) have routinely been positioned by wedging into the pulmonary artery before pulling back 1-2 centimeters or advancing the PAC several centimeters after achieving a pulmonary artery waveform. A rare, major complication is pulmonary artery rupture. This study presents transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for PAC placement by leaving the catheter tip at the one o'clock position, upper window short-axis view of the ascending aorta at the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery (TEE distance). Design: Prospective observational cohort study. Setting: Large urban academic medical center. Participants: 30 males and 30 females undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Intervention: TEE was utilized to obtain an upper esophageal short-axis view of the aorta with long-axis view of the main and right pulmonary arteries. Measurements and Results: The distance between TEE position and wedge position was recorded along with patients' gender, height, and weight. A correlation was found between TEE and wedge distances (P < .0001). There were significant gender differences in TEE distance, with a mean of 43.6 cm in females and 46.5 cm in males (P = .0004). The mean wedge distance was 47.5 cm in females and 51.9 cm in males (P < .0001). The differences between distances of wedge and TEE positions (5.39 cm, males; 3.93 cm, females) were also significant (P < .0001). Conclusions: By securing the PAC at the one o'clock TEE position, physicians are assured of a safety margin of several centimeters. This direct visualization method for PAC placement may decrease the risk for accidental wedging intraoperatively."
444039300003,INFORMATION RETRIEVAL JOURNAL,A non-parametric topical relevance model,"An information retrieval (IR) system can often fail to retrieve relevant documents due to the incomplete specification of information need in the user's query. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) aims to improve IR effectiveness by exploiting potentially relevant aspects of the information need present in the documents retrieved in an initial search. Standard PRF approaches utilize the information contained in these top ranked documents from the initial search with the assumption that documents as a whole are relevant to the information need. However, in practice, documents are often multi-topical where only a portion of the documents may be relevant to the query. In this situation, exploitation of the topical composition of the top ranked documents, estimated with statistical topic modeling based approaches, can potentially be a useful cue to improve PRF effectiveness. The key idea behind our PRF method is to use the term-topic and the document-topic distributions obtained from topic modeling over the set of top ranked documents to re-rank the initially retrieved documents. The objective is to improve the ranks of documents that are primarily composed of the relevant topics expressed in the information need of the query. Our RF model can further be improved by making use of non-parametric topic modeling, where the number of topics can grow according to the document contents, thus giving the RF model the capability to adjust the number of topics based on the content of the top ranked documents. We empirically validate our topic model based RF approach on two document collections of diverse length and topical composition characteristics: (1) ad-hoc retrieval using the TREC 6-8 and the TREC Robust '04 dataset, and (2) tweet retrieval using the TREC Microblog '11 dataset. Results indicate that our proposed approach increases MAP by up to 9% in comparison to the results obtained with an LDA based language model (for initial retrieval) coupled with the relevance model (for feedback). Moreover, the non-parametric version of our proposed approach is shown to be more effective than its parametric counterpart due to its advantage of adapting the number of topics, improving results by up to 5.6% of MAP compared to the parametric version."
430774900017,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,Modeling and solving simultaneous delivery and pick-up problem with stochastic travel and service times in home health care,"Home Health Care (HHC) companies are widespread in European countries and aim to serve patients at home to help them recover from illness and injury in a personal environment. Since transportation costs constitute one of the largest forms of expenditure in the HHC industry, it is of importance to research the optimization of the HHC logistics. This paper considers an HHC routing problem with stochastic travel and service times, which comes from the logistics practice of HHC companies. A Stochastic Programming model with Recourse (SPR model) is proposed based on the specific structure of the supply chain. Three series of experiments are carried out to evaluate the model. Firstly, the SPR model is reduced to the deterministic one, and five approaches (Gurobi Solver, Hybrid Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Bat Algorithm and Firefly Algorithm) are respectively implemented to solve the deterministic model. The SPR model is finally solved by the proposed SA-based heuristic algorithm. Evaluation of the solutions achieved by the two models highlights the advantages of considering stochastic travel and service times. Finally, a case study is given to explain how the SPR model works for an HHC company. This research will help HHC companies to make appropriate decisions when planning their vehicle routes.

This ion exchanger is a part of primary water coolant purification system and shows a non-standard operation in the end of the fuel cycle during high-performance effect. This behaviour consists in process' changes of potassium cation capture from boric acid solution, which is a major chemical of primary cooling water. The experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions on ion exchanger type DOWEX HCR-S NG and the samples with different concentrations of analytes (K+, NH4+, Li+, H3BO3) were measured. The results confirmed the anomalous behaviour of ion exchanger during high-performance effect when the potassium ions are captured on SAC due to its size and the lack of boric acid in water coolant. Therefore, the potassium hydroxide must be dosed into the primary water to control the content of alkali metals."

Further reaction of beta-keto ester with hydrazine hydrate results in the formation of spiro-piperidinyl pyrazolone scaffold 5a-d which upon N-benzylation followed by deprotection yields compounds 7a-s. The pyrazolone-NH group has been alkylated in compound 5a with ethyl chloroacetate followed by hydrolysis and amide coupling to afford compounds 9a-d. The furan ring in compound 5a is oxidized to carboxylic acid with KMnO4 and coupled with amines to prepare amide derivatives 11a-c. All the synthesized compounds are evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial and antioxidant activity. Compounds 7a-d and 7g-s are found to possess high antibacterial activity and compounds 7a,7b, 9a, 9b, 11a and 11c are found to be potent antioxidants."
438981700011,PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,Expansion and diversification of the gibberellin receptor GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) family in land plants,"Here we uncover the major evolutionary events shaping the evolution of the GID1 family of gibberellin receptors in land plants at the sequence, structure and gene expression levels. Gibberellic acid (gibberellin, GA) controls key developmental processes in the life cycle of land plants. By interacting with the GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor, GA regulates the expression of a wide range of genes through different pathways. Here we report the systematic identification and classification of GID1s in 54 plants genomes, encompassing from bryophytes and lycophytes, to several monocots and eudicots. We investigated the evolutionary relationship of GID1s using a comparative genomics framework and found strong support for a previously proposed phylogenetic classification of this family in land plants. We identified lineage-specific expansions of particular subfamilies (i.e. GID1ac and GID1b) in different eudicot lineages (e.g. GID1b in legumes). Further, we found both, shared and divergent structural features between GID1ac and GID1b subgroups in eudicots that provide mechanistic insights on their functions. Gene expression data from several species show that at least one GID1 gene is expressed in every sampled tissue, with a strong bias of GID1b expression towards underground tissues and dry legume seeds (which typically have low GA levels). Taken together, our results indicate that GID1ac retained canonical GA signaling roles, whereas GID1b specialized in conditions of low GA concentrations. We propose that this functional specialization occurred initially at the gene expression level and was later fine-tuned by mutations that conferred greater GA affinity to GID1b, including a Phe residue in the GA-binding pocket. Finally, we discuss the importance of our findings to understand the diversification of GA perception mechanisms in land plants."
441916300009,STATISTICAL PAPERS,The impact of estimation uncertainty on covariate effects in nonlinear models,"Covariate effects are a key consideration in model evaluation, forecasting, and policy analysis, yet their dependence on estimation uncertainty has been largely overlooked in previous work. We discuss several approaches to covariate effect evaluation in nonlinear models, examine computational and reporting issues, and illustrate the practical implications of ignoring estimation uncertainty in a simulation study and applications to educational attainment and crime. The evidence reveals that failing to consider estimation variability and relying solely on parameter point estimates may lead to nontrivial biases in covariate effects that can be exacerbated in certain settings, underscoring the pivotal role that estimation uncertainty can play in this context."
441644200016,HYDROMETALLURGY,The dissolution of phosphorus from Jamaican bauxites under low temperature Bayer conditions,"Jamaica has about 7.1% of world bauxite reserves however the ore characteristics vary significantly depending on mining location and mineralogy. Traditionally, low phosphorus hematite-rich deposits from south central Jamaica are processed in a low temperature alumina refinery but these ores are becoming depleted and will be replaced by high phosphorus goethite-rich resources that are located north of the current mines. Depending on type, P-minerals may dissolve during bauxite digestion, accumulate in the liquor and negatively impact the process. This work compares the caustic extractable PO43- from the traditional and future bauxite mining areas and seeks to develop a model to predict soluble PO43- concentrations from their total phosphorus levels measured via XRF. Filtered liquors from the low temperature caustic digestion of 104 samples from a goethiterich future-bauxite reserve (0.4-32.8% PO43-) and 30 hematite-rich samples (0.1-1.27% PO43-) from current mines were analyzed for soluble PO43- concentrations using the ascorbic acid molybdenum blue spectrophotometric procedure. The concentrations of PO43- in liquor increased dramatically with processing of the goethite-rich ores (5-21,000 mg PO43-/L) in comparison to digestion of the traditional hematite-rich bauxites (52-319 mg PO43-/L if one unusual sample is excluded). An empirical equation (mg PO43-/L = 0.085(mg PO4/ kg) + 103; R-2 = 0.93) is proposed that uses the total phosphate concentrations of goethite-rich bauxites to predict the soluble PO43- concentrations of their digestion liquors to within 20% of the measured values. A comparable equation (mg PO43-/L = 0.082 mg PO43-/kg- 26; R-2 = 0.67) to predict caustic soluble phosphorus from the hematite-rich ores was also developed however it has a larger margin of error. The correlations are applicable only to normal bauxite samples from the specific mining areas and with Ca:PO43- ratios of < 0.40; they are less effective at higher ratios however as apatite or calcite is often present in such bauxites and results in lower than usual soluble PO43- concentrations. Evaluation of the Ca:PO43- ratios in the bauxites in conjunction with the measured soluble PO43- concentrations confirms that crandallite is the dominant P mineral in both the hematite-rich and goethite-rich bauxites."

The development targets application in eye-safe automotive LIDAR systems, which would benefit from deploying narrowband receiver filters to block ambient solar radiation for improved signal-to-noise ratio. The surface grating is monolithically integrated on the laser chip using nanoimprint lithography. The peak power of the lasers exceeded 6 W in pulsed mode, for an FWHM spectral width of 0.3 nm and a peak wavelength drift of only 0.1 nm/degrees C. The wavelength shift with temperature is reduced by five times compared to broad area high-power Fabry-Perot laser diodes typically employed in LIDAR systems."
445724800020,ACS CENTRAL SCIENCE,A Lamin-Binding Ligand Inhibits Homologous Recombination Repair of DNA Double-Strand Breaks,"Nuclear lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins. Lamins, including LA, LB1, LB2, and LC, are the major protein components forming the nuclear lamina to support the mechanical stability of the mammalian cell nucleus. Increasing evidence has shown that LA participates in homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the mechanisms underlying this process are incompletely understood. We recently identified the first lamin-binding ligand 1 (LBL1) that directly binds LA and inhibited cancer cell growth. We provided here further mechanistic investigations of LBL1 and revealed that LA interacts with the HR recombinase Rad51 to protect Rad51 from degradation. LBL1 inhibits LA-Rad51 interaction leading to accelerated proteasome-mediated degradation of Rad51, culminating in inhibition of HR repair of DSBs. These results uncover a novel post-translational regulation of Rad51 by LA and suggest that targeting the LA-Rad51 axis may represent a promising strategy to develop cancer therapeutics."

To this end we prove the existence of the weak adiabatic limit, generalizing the results due to Blanchard and Seneor. Our proof is valid under the assumption that the time-ordered products satisfy certain normalization condition. We show that this normalization condition may be imposed in all models with interaction vertices of canonical dimension 4 as well as in all models with interaction vertices of canonical dimension 3 provided each of them contains at least one massive field. Moreover, we prove that it is compatible with all the standard normalization conditions which are usually imposed on the time-ordered products. The result applies, for example, to quantum electrodynamics and non-abelian Yang-Mills theories."

It is demonstrated that over the life span of 50 years, in comparison to the typical house, the net zero energy house accounts for 81%, 77%, 90%, 63% and 69% less impacts in terms of global warming, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication and photochemical ozone creation, respectively. In a life cycle perspective, the energy plus house is found to be carbon negative and offers net savings towards terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication and photochemical ozone creation as well; thanks to its ability to export roof top PV generated electricity to the public grid. The energy plus house is, however, noted to account for 35% higher metal depletion potential in comparison to the typical house. Despite offering considerable environmental impacts reductions in a life cycle perspective, these energy efficient houses are noted to account for higher embodied impacts associated with their manufacturing and maintenance stages in comparison to a typical house. PV panels account for most of these additional embodied impacts and particularly for the energy plus case, are noted to dominate all other materials, even concrete and steel."
453631900003,PARASITES & VECTORS,"Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in canine population and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato) ticks from southern Metro Manila and Laguna, Philippines","BackgroundThe tropical climate of the Philippines and the high population of dogs, particularly in cities, favors the life-cycle of the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato), a vector of several canine tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) including zoonotic Rickettsia spp. Suspected cases of infections are commonly encountered in veterinary clinics, but the specific TBPs are rarely identified. Furthermore, infection with Rickettsia is not being clinically examined in dogs. In this study, the occurrence of TBPs in blood and ticks collected from household and impounded dogs in highly populated areas of the Philippines, Metro Manila, and the nearby province of Laguna, was examined.ResultsA total of 248 blood samples and 157 tick samples were subjected to PCR. First, samples were screened using primers for Anaplasma/Ehrlichia spp. and Babesia/Hepatozoon spp. Those that turned positive were further subjected to species-specific PCR. Rickettsia spp. were also detected through a nested PCR. Of the 248 blood samples, 56 (22.6%) were positive for Anaplasma/Ehrlichia spp., while 19 (7.6%) were positive for Babesia/Hepatozoon spp. Species-specific PCR revealed that 61 (23.4%) had a single TBP, with Ehrlichia canis being detected in 39 (15.7%) dogs, while 14 (5.6%) dogs were positive for different combinations of two to four TBPs. Rickettsia infection was detected in 6 (2.4%) dogs. In tick samples, 8 (3.2%) were positive for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp., while only 1 (0.63%) was positive for Babesia/Hepatozoon spp. As in the blood samples, E. canis was the most detected, being found in 5 (2%) samples. No tick samples tested positive for Rickettsia spp.ConclusionEhrlichia canis is the most common TBP affecting dogs in the Philippines. Co-infection with TBPs is quite common, hence testing for multiple TBPs is necessary. Through nested PCR, Rickettsia infection was detected in dogs, and to the authors' knowledge, this study provides the first molecular evidence of Rickettsia infection in dogs in the Philippines."

422864800035,RSC ADVANCES,Integration of the 3DOM Al/Co3O4 nanothermite film with a semiconductor bridge to realize a high-output micro-energetic igniter,"Microigniters play an important role for the reliable initiation of micro explosive devices. However, the microigniter is still limited by the low out-put energy to realize high reliability and safety. Integration of energetic materials with microigniters is an effective method to enhance the ignition ability. In this work, a Al/Co3O4 nanothermite film with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure was prepared by the deposition of nanoscale Al layers using magnetron sputtering on Co3O4 skeletons that are synthesized using an inverse template method. Both the uniform structure and nanoscale contact between the Al layers and the Co3O4 skeletons lead to an excellent exothermicity. In order to investigate the ignition properties, a micro-energetic igniter has been fabricated by the integration of the Al/Co3O4 nanothermite film with a semiconductor bridge microigniter. The thermite reactions between the nanoscale Al layer and the Co3O4 skeleton extensively promote the intensity of the spark, the length in duration and the size of the area, which greatly enhance the ignition reliability of the micro-energetic igniter. Moreover, this novel design enables the micro-energetic igniter to fire the pyrotechnic Zr/Pb3O4 in a gap of 3.7 mm by capacitor discharge stimulation and to keep the intrinsic instantaneity high and firing energy low. The realization of gap ignition will surely improve the safety level of initiating systems and have a significant impact on the design and application of explosive devices."

Our method is rigorously derived by utilizing a classical result from Extreme-Value Theory, the Pickands-Balkema-de Haan theorem. The robustness of the scheme is demonstrated by proving sharp error-bounds for the approximated curves with respect to the supremum and L-2 norms. The practical implications of our findings are examined by applying it to Industry Loss Warranties: the method performs very accurately for each transaction. Our approach can be used in a variety of applications such as vendor model blending, portfolio optimization and premium calculation."
446138300001,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Effects of Ability and Effort Praise on Children's Failure Attribution, Self-Handicapping, and Performance","Previous research has suggested that children praised for ability are more likely to attribute their failure to low ability compared to those who are praised for effort. At the same time, self-worth theory suggests that when an individual's self-worth is threatened, they are likely to use a self-serving attributional strategy and self-handicapping. From the perspective of self-worth theory, the present study investigated how ability and effort praise influenced children's failure attribution, self-handicapping, and their subsequent performance compared to simple informational feedback. Fifth graders (N = 103, average age = 11.2 years, SD = 0.71) were randomly assigned to three praise conditions (ability, effort, or no praise). The results revealed that children praised for ability were more likely to attribute their subsequent failure to non-ability factors and indicate more claimed and behavioral self-handicapping than children who were praised for effort or not praised at all. As behavioral self-handicapping created actual obstacles to progress, children praised for ability made significantly less improvement in their performance than those in the other two groups. In addition, the findings showed that children praised for effort also adopted the claimed self-handicapping and defensive attributional strategies compared to those in the no-praise conditions. These results indicate that parents and teachers should not haphazardly administer praise. Implications for parents, teachers, and future research directions, including the replication of this study in diverse cultural settings, conditions of effort praise, and effects of other types of praise, are discussed."
426940000002,JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING,"THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF PANELS WITH HIGH DENSITY, RANDOMLY ORIENTED STRAW BALES","This paper describes the hot-box testing (based on ASTM C1363-11) of seven straw bale wall panels to obtain their thermal conductivity values. All panels were constructed with stacked bales and cement-lime plaster skins on each side of the bales. Four panels were made with traditional, 2-string field bales of densities ranging from 89.5 kg/m(3)-131 kg/m(3) and with the bales on-edge (fibres perpendicular to the heat flow). Three panels were made with manufactured high-density bales (291 kg/m(3)-372 kg/m(3)). The fibres of the manufactured bales were randomly oriented. The key conclusion of this paper is that within the experimental error, there is no difference in the thermal conductivity value for panels using normal density bales and manufactured high density bales up to a density of 333 kg/m(3). However, because of lack of precision of the hot-box, no conclusions can be made on the true thermal conductivity of the high density bale panels. In addition, the panels tested were found to have significant voids between bales, and this is believed to have contributed to higher measured thermal conductivity values compared to those reported in the literature for normal density bale panels. Thermal properties may be affected for bales with higher densities than 333 kg/m(3), therefore further testing is suggested."
424317300006,SURGERY,Hepatic vein management in a parenchyma-sparing policy for resecting colorectal liver metastases at the caval confluence,"Background. Patients with tumors involving hepatic vein at the caval-confluence usually receive major hepatectomies or hepatic vein grafting; however, nonnegligible postoperative mortality and morbidity are associated. Authors introduced the tumor-vessel detachment for colorectal liver metastases. Then we reviewed our results applying this approach in patients with colorectal liver metastases in contact with hepatic veins at the caval-confluence. Methods. A cohort of consecutive patients with colorectal liver metastases in contact with hepatic veins at the caval-confluence undergoing liver surgery was reviewed. Relationships were classified as: Type 1: contact/involvement less than a third of hepatic vein circumference; Type 2: contact/involvement in a third to two-thirds; Type 3: contact/involvement in more than two-thirds. Hepatic vein-colorectal liver metastases detachment, or in case of hepatic vein-resection, the sparing of the drained parenchyma, were attempted systematically. Results. Overall 190 colorectal liver metastases-hepatic vein contacts in 135 patients were analyzed. Colorectal liver metastases-hepatic vein detachment was performed in 95 (50%) contacts, partial resection and direct suture in 61 (32%), partial resection and patching in 4 (2%), and hepatic vein complete resection in 30 (16%). Hepatic vein-sparing resection was possible in 102 patients (76%), and major hepatectomy was needed in 1 (0.7%). Operative mortality, overall and major morbidity rate were 0.7%, 32%, and 4%, respectively. Local recurrence rate was 6% (median follow-up: 27 months). Preoperative and intraoperative imaging predicted the need for hepatic vein resection in 99% of patients (kappa=0.971). Conclusions. Hepatic vein-sparing or a parenchyma-sparing policy is feasible in most patients with colorectal liver metastases-hepatic vein contacts at the caval-confluence. This approach seems safe, predictable, and oncologically adequate, and, upon further confirmation, could become an alternative to major hepatectomies or hepatic vein replacement.

428399000010,FAMILY PROCESS,A Population-Based Comparison of Female and Male Same-Sex Parent and Different-Sex Parent Households,"This investigation compared Dutch same-sex parent and different-sex parent households on children's psychological well-being, parenting stress, and support in child rearing. It was also assessed whether associations among children's well-being, parenting stress, and support in child rearing were different in the two household types. Data were based on a nationally representative survey (N=25,250). Matching was used to enhance similarity in background characteristics between both types of families. Parental and child characteristics were matched for 43 female same-sex parent, 52 male same-sex parent, and 95 different-sex parent households with offspring between 5 and 18 years old. No significant differences were found on children's well-being, problems in the parent-child relationship, being worried about the child, or the use of formal and informal support between mothers in same-sex and different-sex parent households or for fathers in same-sex and different-sex parent households. Regarding perceived confidence in child rearing, fathers in same-sex parent households and mothers in different-sex parent households felt less competent than their counterparts. Neither the associations between children's well-being and the predictors (parenting stress variables) nor those between support and the predictors (parenting stress and children's well-being) differed along household type. In this population-based study, the similarity in child outcomes regardless of household type confirms the results of prior investigations based on convenience samples. These findings are pertinent to family therapists, practitioners, court officials, and policymakers who seek information on parenting experiences and child outcomes in female and male same-sex parent families."
434310200025,MEDICINE,Surgical management of tumor-positive interval node in melanoma patients: An observational study,"The presence of interval nodes (IN) in melanoma is testified in several studies and sometimes these lymph nodes can contain metastatic disease. Currently there are no guidelines about the management of patients with tumor-positive INs.We enrolled all patients affected by melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in a single institution. All patients with tumor-positive IN underwent the lymphadenectomy of the subsequent draining lymphatic field. Prognosis of IN+-patients was compared with subjects with positive SLNB in usual field through Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analysis.Overall 596 subjects underwent lymphoscintigraphy and one or more INs were identified in 94 (15.8%) patients. The mean number of sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) identified per patient was significantly higher in patients with INs. Macrometastasis were more common in patients with INs. Matched pair analysis testified a statistically significant better prognosis in patients with positive-INs when compared with patients with positive SNs in usual side with the same demographic and clinical characteristics. These findings were confirmed both in analysis of 10-year recurrence-free period, then in 10-years overall survival analysis.Lymphadenectomy of the lymphatic draining field beyond positive-IN testify has proved to be a safe procedure that may improve prognosis in melanoma patients with tumor-positive INs. The better prognosis of patients with tumor-positive INs undergoing lymphadenectomy may be justified by the earlier treatment of lymphatic metastases. Further multicentric comparative studies are needed to evaluate possible impact of this procedure on prognosis of melanoma patients."
436570100311,SUSTAINABILITY,An Admission Control Mechanism for 5G LWA,"To alleviate the spectrum scarcity problem in fifth-generation (5G) networks, traditional mobile data offloading schemes from long term evolution (LTE) to wireless local area networks (WLANs) have been revised by the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) in release 13, which is known as LTE-WLAN aggregation (LWA). With LWA, user equipment units (UEs) supporting both LTE and WLAN can utilize both LTE and WLAN links simultaneously. Thus, UEs under the coverage of an LWA network will be surrounded by multiple standards, such as LTE, WLAN, and LWA, along with cells of different sizes and coverage. Providing the LWA service to all UEs unconditionally may lead to serious intra-cell unfairness, degradation of system-level quality of service (QoS), and a reduction in system resource utilization. Hence, to resolve this issue, two important challenges need to be addressed: Which LTE UEs should be transferred, and how many LTE UEs need to be transferred. In this paper, we propose a user-offloading algorithm for evolved node B (eNB) hardware that smartly allocates the deprived LTE UEs and assigns the LWA service to an optimal number of UEs without degrading the QoS for existing WLAN UEs. With this proposed scheme, all LWA-preferred UEs with poor LTE performance and a good WLAN condition have the opportunity to access LWA service to improve performance. We show that the proposed scheme maximizes the throughput performance of the whole network."
445881700021,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE,"The effect of periodic energy restriction on growth performance, serum biochemical indices, and meat quality in sheep","Energy is a key factor regulated by the neuroendocrine system. The objective of this study was to compare growth performance, serum biochemical indices, carcass traits, meat quality, and nutrient composition of lambs fed restricted metabolizable energy (ME) intakes to mimic the seasonal changes of the natural grasslands of northwest China. Nineteen male Dorper x Small Tailed Han lambs were assigned to treatments, control (CON) fed at 1.0 MJ/W-0.75 x d(-1) throughout the 180 d study, and restricted ME (RES) fed by sequentially restricting ME every 30 d (0.56, 0.84, 1.0, 0.84, 0.56, and 0.28 MJ/W-0.75 x d(-1)). Lambs were harvested at the end of the study. Lambs fed the CON diet demonstrated higher (P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) compared with RESfed lambs (158.79 and 57.01 g/d, for CON and RES, respectively), although ADG were lower in each period with the last period being a negative ADG for RES-fed lambs resulting in a loss of body weight. Both treatments demonstrated lower ADG in the last 3 study periods compared with the first 2 periods, which may be explained by cold stress (<-3 degrees C) increasing the lamb's energy requirement. Feeding lambs a restricted ME diet resulted in lower (P < 0.05) blood serum glucose, triglycerides, total protein, calcium, phosphorus, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A concentrations compared with CON-fed lambs, but both treatments were similar (P > 0.05) for cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein- cholesterol. Feeding lambs a restricted ME diet increased (P < 0.05) meat pH, while reducing the cooked meat rate compared with CON-fed lambs. Thus, the carcass yield, rib eye muscle area, and shear force were lower (P < 0.05) for RES-fed lambs compared with CON-fed lambs. The meat water concentration was higher (P < 0.05), whereas the concentrations of dry matter, crude fat, crude protein, and carbohydrate were lower (P < 0.05) for lambs fed a RES ME diet compared to CONfed lambs. These results demonstrate that sequentially restricting ME intake, as natural grasslands might experience during seasonal forage quality and quantity changes, resulted in a reduction of body weight because lambs were mobilizing body reserves as a source of ME. The reduction in concentrations of key serum nutrients, as well as carcass traits and meat composition, demonstrate the body is responding to the meet the lambs ME requirements, which has implications for both meat quality and the animal's physiological functions."
442465300020,GUT,"High BMI in late adolescence predicts future severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma: a national, population-based cohort study in 1.2 million men","Objective A high body mass index (BMI) is associated with an increased risk for severe liver disease. It is unclear if this risk differs across BMI categories, and if the association is partially attributed to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Design We used register data from more than 1.2 million Swedish men enlisted for conscription between 1969 and 1996. Data regarding new events of severe liver disease and T2DM during follow-up were obtained by record-linkage of population-based registers. We used Cox regression to estimate adjusted HRs for future inpatient care and mortality in severe liver disease and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) across BMI categories, using BMI of 18.5-22.5 kg/m(2) as reference. Results During a follow-up of more than 34 million person-years, 5281 cases of severe liver disease including 251 cases of HCC were identified. An association with severe liver disease was found for overweight (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.64) and for obese men (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.59). Development of T2DM further increased the risk for severe liver disease across all BMI categories, for instance, men with obesity and T2DM had a higher risk of severe liver disease (HR 3.28, 95% CI 2.27 to 4.74) than men with obesity free of T2DM (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.72 to 2.54). Conclusions A high BMI in late adolescent men was associated with an increased risk of future severe liver disease, including HCC. Development of T2DM during follow-up was associated with a further increased risk of severe liver disease, independent of baseline BMI."
433953200012,ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH,Robust equity portfolio performance,"The earliest documented analytical approach to portfolio selection is Markowitz's mean-variance analysis, which attempts to find the portfolio with optimal performance by considering the tradeoff between return and risk. The performance of mean-variance analysis has been the subject of many studies and compared to other portfolio construction approaches such as a na < ve equally-weighted allocation scheme. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to improve the mean-variance model by reducing the sensitivity of the portfolio selection process in order achieve robust performance. Although robust portfolio optimization has been one of the most researched methods for improving portfolio robustness, the performance of robust portfolios has not been the major focus of studies. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis on robust portfolio performance is presented for equity portfolios constructed in the U.S. market during the period 1980 and 2014, and results confirm the advantage of robust portfolio optimization for controlling uncertainty while efficiently allocating investments."

444927700026,MARINE STRUCTURES,Effects of the PTO inclination on the performance of the CECO wave energy converter,"This work investigates the performance of CECO, a third-generation wave energy converter of the oscillating bodies group. The power matrices of the device - which represent the wave power absorbed for different sea states - are obtained for five PTO inclinations. Then, the wave climate along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula is characterized by means of the wave energy resource matrices. With the power matrices and the wave energy resource matrices, the performance of the device along the area of study is determined for each PTO inclination. To achieve this, the performance of CECO is assessed by means of a panel model based on the boundary element method, while the wave conditions in the area of study are assessed with a wave propagation spectral model. The results allow fulfilling an important knowledge gap concerning the impact of the PTO inclination on the performance of CECO, which was found to be very significant. In addition, the insight obtained will contribute to optimize future versions of CECO and other wave energy converters of the oscillating body type."

457772600005,OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY,Assessment of the Importance of Tympanic Membrane Mechanoreceptors on Eustachian Tube Function Based on Pressure Chamber Measurements,"Introduction:Previously, it was demonstrated how the Eustachian tube (ET) opening function can be influenced by middle ear pressure and movement of the tympanic membrane via neural control. Mechanoreceptors on the tympanic membrane may be part of the afferent arc and could influence the middle ear pressure by activating the musculus veli palatini as part of a reflex.Methods:In a hypo and hyperbaric pressure chamber, 17 participants (34 ears) were twice exposed to a standardized pressure profile of pressure decrease and increase. The ET function reflecting parametersET opening pressure (ETOP), ET opening duration (ETOD), and ET opening frequency (ETOF)were determined before and after local anesthesia of the right tympanic membrane.Results:After pressure exposure by pressure increase (active induced equalization) and pressure decrease (passive equalization) there was no significant difference between the mean value of ETOP, ETOD, and ETOF before and after local anesthesia of the right tympanic membrane on the right (anesthetized) or left side (not anesthetized).Conclusion:These results may lead to the hypothesis that tympanic membrane mechanoreceptors may play a minor role in regulating the ET function in humans."
435510100011,PEERJ,Transcriptomic evidence for involvement of reactive oxygen species in Rhizoctonia solani AG1 IA sclerotia maturation,"Rhizoctonia solani AG1 IA is a soil-borne fungal phytopathogen that can significantly harm crops resulting in economic loss. This species overwinters in grass roots and diseased plants, and produces sclerotia that infect future crops. R. solani AG1 IA does not produce spores; therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism of sclerotia formation is important for crop disease control. To identify the genes involved in this process for the development of disease control targets, the transcriptomes of this species were determined at three important developmental stages (mycelium, sclerotial initiation, and sclerotial maturation) using an RNA-sequencing approach. A total of 5,016, 6,433, and 5,004 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the sclerotial initiation vs. mycelial, sclerotial maturation vs. mycelial, and sclerotial maturation vs. sclerotial initiation stages, respectively. Moreover, gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that these DEGs were enriched in diverse categories, including oxidoreductase activity, carbohydrate metabolic process, and oxidation-reduction processes. A total of 12 DEGs were further verified using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Among the genes examined, NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were highly induced in the stages of sclerotial initiation and maturation. In addition, the highest reactive oxygen species (ROS) production levels were detected during sclerotial initiation, and enzyme activities of NOX1, SOD, and catalase (CAT) matched with the gene expression profiles. To further evaluate the role of ROS in sclerotial formation, R. solani AG1 IA was treated with the CAT inhibitor aminotriazole and H2O2, resulting in the early differentiation of sclerotia. Taken together, this study provides useful information toward understanding the molecular basis of R. solani AG1 IA sclerotial formation and maturation, and identified the important role of ROS in these processes."
459052300008,PERSPECTIVES ON BEHAVIOR SCIENCE,Behavioral Research with Planaria,"This article serves as a brief primer on planaria for behavior scientists. In the 1950s and 1960s, McConnell's planarian laboratory posited that conditioned behavior could transfer after regeneration, and through cannibalization of trained planaria. These studies, the responses, and replications have been collectively referred to as the ""planarian controversy."" Successful behavioral assays still require refinement with this organism, but they could add valuable insight into our conceptualization of memory and learning. We discuss how the planarian's distinctive biology enables an examination of biobehavioral interaction models, and what behavior scientists must consider if they are to advance behavioral research with this organism. Suggestions for academics interested in building planaria learning laboratories are offered."
452348200005,JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Involvement of 5-HT2A receptor hyperfunction in the anxiety-like behavior induced by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide combination treatment in rats,"We examined whether combination treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, a traditional chemotherapy for breast cancer, induced anxiety-like behavior in rats. Furthermore, we evaluated the role of the serotonin (5-HT)(2A) receptor subtype in the anxiety-like behavior induced by such chemotherapy. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide once a week for 2 weeks. This caused the rats to display anxiety-like behavior during the lightedark test. In addition, we examined the rats' 5-HT2A receptor-mediated behavioral responses. Combination treatment with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide significantly increased (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane, (a 5-HT2A receptor agonist)-induced wet-dog shake activity. This anxiety-like behavior was significantly inhibited by mirtazapine, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist/5-HT1A receptor agonist, and tandospirone, a partial 5-HT1A receptor agonist, but not by fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The anxiety-like behavior induced by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide combination treatment is mediated by hyperfunctioning of the 5-HT2A receptor. Thus, 5-HT2A receptor antagonists or 5-HT1A receptor agonists might be useful for treating chemotherapy-induced anxiety disorders. (c) 2018 The Authors.

447213500002,NANOTECHNOLOGY,"Dual-plasmonic Au/graphene/Au-enhanced ultrafast, broadband, self-driven silicon Schottky photodetector","High-performance photodetectors are desirable for various applications, including multi-wavelength image sensing, communication, and safety monitoring. In this study, we report the construction of a dual-surface plasmon-enhanced silicon Schottky photodetector using Au nanoparticles (NPs)/graphene/Au NPs hybrid structure as the electrode. It was found that the asassembled device exhibited broad sensitivity, ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared light (360-1330 nm) at room temperature, with a high response speed of 360 ns and a 3 dB bandwidth of 780 kHz at zero bias. Further theoretical simulation based on the finite-element method revealed that good device performance is associated with the contribution of the Au NPs/graphene/Au NPs electrode: intense dual-plasmonic resonance coupling is induced in a hybrid structure of two layers of metallic NPs separated by a uniform monolayer graphene. It not only can enhance light trapping and the localized electric field at the resonant and off-resonant wavelength regions, but is also beneficial for the tunneling of hot electrons. This work demonstrated the great potential of dual-plasmonic resonance coupling in optoelectronic devices and will lead to the development of advanced plasmonic devices."
452650200013,NATURE ENERGY,Fine-tuning of the chemical structure of photoactive materials for highly efficient organic photovoltaics,"The performance of organic photovoltaics is largely dependent on the balance of short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and opencircuit voltage (V-oc). For instance, the reduction of the active materials' optical bandgap, which increases the J(sc), would inevitably lead to a concomitant reduction in V-oc. Here, we demonstrate that careful tuning of the chemical structure of photoactive materials can enhance both J(sc), and V-oc simultaneously. Non-fullerene organic photovoltaics based on a well-matched materials combination exhibit a certified high power conversion efficiency of 12.25% on a device area of 1 cm(2). By combining Fouriertransform photocurrent spectroscopy and electroluminescence, we show the existence of a low but non-negligible charge transfer state as the possible origin of V-oc loss. This study highlights that the reduction of the bandgap to improve the efficiency requires a careful materials design to minimize non-radiative V-oc losses."
426721400209,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Australia's Ongoing Legacy of Asbestos: Significant Challenges Remain Even after the Complete Banning of Asbestos Almost Fifteen Years Ago,"The most effective way of reducing the global burden of asbestos-related diseases is through the implementation of asbestos bans and minimising occupational and non-occupational exposure to respirable asbestos fibres. Australia's asbestos consumption peaked in the 1970s with Australia widely thought to have had among the highest per-capita asbestos consumption level of any country. Australia's discontinuation of all forms of asbestos and asbestos-containing products and materials did not occur at a single point of time. Crocidolite consumption ceased in the late 1960s, followed by amosite consumption stopping in the mid 1980s. Despite significant government reports being published in 1990 and 1999, it was not until the end of 2003 that a complete ban on all forms of asbestos (crocidolite, amosite, and chrysotile) was introduced in Australia. The sustained efforts of trade unions and non-governmental organisations were essential in forcing the Australian government to finally implement the 2003 asbestos ban. Trade unions and non-government organisations continue to play a key role today in monitoring the government's response to Australian asbestos-related disease epidemic. There are significant challenges that remain in Australia, despite a complete asbestos ban being implemented almost fifteen years ago. The Australian epidemic of asbestos-related disease has only now reached its peak. A total of 16,679 people were newly diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma between 1982 and 2016, with 84% of cases occurring in men. There has been a stabilisation of the age-standardised malignant mesothelioma incidence rate in the last 10 years. In 2016, the incidence rate per 100,000 was 2.5 using the Australian standard population and 1.3 using the Segi world standard population. Despite Australia's complete asbestos ban being in place since 2003, public health efforts must continue to focus on preventing the devastating effects of avoidable asbestos-related diseases, including occupational and non-occupational groups who are potentially at risk from exposure to respirable asbestos fibres."

440664300024,CHEST,Ultrasound Fissure Observation Assessment of Lung by Pleural-Hub Affiliates,"BACKGROUND: Lung ultrasound examination is becoming an even more important part of pulmonologists' clinical routine. As indicated in the literature, the coordinates of any findings on lung parenchyma are based on surface landmarks or conventional quadrants. In our experience we have noticed that lung fissures are clearly detectable as interruptions of the pleural line, but this has never been investigated previously. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether lung fissures are detectable under normal conditions in routine clinical practice. METHODS: Ten operators were enrolled from Pleural-Hub, a scientific discussion group. After compiling a prestudy survey to investigate whether they had observed fissures previously, they were asked to note if the following fissures were detectable: posterior right (PR) and left (PL), lateral right (LR) and left (LL), anterior right (AR), and anterolateral left (AL). Enrollment was competitive, aiming to reach 100 case subjects. RESULTS: We found that general fissure detection was 61.3%, in particular: PR, 59%; LR, 75%; AR, 69%; PL, 45%; LL, 64%; AL, 56%. Single operators yielded different detection rates ranging from 90% to 25%, showing strong operator dependency. Before being made aware of general results operators indicated operator's skill and rib shadow artifacts as the principal factors affecting fissure detection. CONCLUSIONS: Lung fissures may be detected with ultrasound once adequate training is provided. This may allow the clinician a more precise anatomical delineation of pathology identified by lung ultrasound."

Sixty Hu lambs (23.02 +/- 1.36kg) were randomly divided into four experimental groups receiving diets containing 0%, 5%, 10% or 15% perilla seed (CD, 5%PFSD, 10%PFSD and 15%PFSD, respectively). The addition of perilla seed had no significant impacts on carcass traits (p>.05). There were no differences in pH, meat colour, drip loss, cooking loss or shear force among the four treatments (p>.05). Addition of perilla seed increased (p<.05) deposition of intramuscular lipids but had no effect on other chemical components in the longissimus dorsi (LD) (p>.05). The 15%PFSD diet decreased the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the liver (p<.05 for both) but increased the activity of these antioxidant enzymes in LD (p<.05 for both). Compared to CD, addition of perilla seed increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) expression in the liver and LD (p<.05 for all). These results indicate that perilla seed supplementation in lambs' diets can increase deposition of intramuscular lipids and improve muscular oxidative status and meat quality."

444287600037,INFLAMMATION,Changes of Treg/Th17 Ratio in Spleen of Acute Gouty Arthritis Rat Induced by MSU Crystals,"Acute gouty arthritis is the inflammation of joint tissues in the acute form due to the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells play an important role in the development and progression of inflammatory diseases. However, the expression and role of Tregs and Th17 cells are not clear in this disease. Here, we investigated the changes of Tregs, Th17 cells, and Treg/Th17 ratio in spleen, as well as the inflammatory cytokines in blood and joint tissue pathology in acute gouty arthritis rat induced by MSU. We found that both the percentages of Tregs and Th17 cells in spleen increased at an early stage (6h). Tregs decreased at 12 and 24h, and rise again at 48 and 72h. However, Th17 cells reached its peak at 24h, and then decreased after 48h. Treg/Th17 ratio showed an initial decrease and then increase, and further reached its minimum value at 24h. But the ratios of Treg/Th17at all times were lower than that of normal control. The level of serum cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-, and IL-10) showed an opposite trend to Treg/Th17 ratio, except the level of TGF-(1) was similar to Tregs. In summary, Tregs and Th17 cells in spleen changed over time during the development of acute gouty arthritis. Decrease of Treg/Th17 ratio was consistent with inflammation development in the joints, suggesting that Treg/Th17 imbalance may involve in pathogenesis of acute gouty arthritis."
444229700012,PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL,Characterization of the hypersensitive response-like cell death phenomenon induced by targeting antiviral lectin griffithsin to the secretory pathway,"Griffithsin (GRFT) is an antiviral lectin, originally derived from a red alga, which is currently being investigated as a topical microbicide to prevent transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Targeting GRFT to the apoplast for production in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in necrotic symptoms associated with a hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death, accompanied by H2O2 generation and increased PR1 expression. Mannose-binding lectins surfactant protein D (SP-D), cyanovirin-N (CV-N) and human mannose-binding lectin (hMBL) also induce salicylic acid (SA)-dependent HR-like cell death in N. benthamiana, and this effect is mediated by the lectin's glycan binding activity. We found that secreted GRFT interacts with an endogenous glycoprotein, alpha-xylosidase (XYL1), which is involved in cell wall organization. The necrotic effect could be mitigated by overexpression of Arabidopsis XYL1, and by co-expression of SA-degrading enzyme NahG, providing strategies for enhancing expression of oligomannose-binding lectins in plants."
424111400004,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Genomics meets applied ecology: Characterizing habitat quality for sloths in a tropical agroecosystem,"Understanding how habitat quality in heterogeneous landscapes governs the distribution and fitness of individuals is a fundamental aspect of ecology. While mean individual fitness is generally considered a key to assessing habitat quality, a comprehensive understanding of habitat quality in heterogeneous landscapes requires estimates of dispersal rates among habitat types. The increasing accessibility of genomic approaches, combined with field-based demographic methods, provides novel opportunities for incorporating dispersal estimation into assessments of habitat quality. In this study, we integrated genomic kinship approaches with field-based estimates of fitness components and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) procedures to estimate habitat-specific dispersal rates and characterize habitat quality in two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) occurring in a Costa Rican agricultural ecosystem. Field-based observations indicated that birth and survival rates were similar in a sparsely shaded cacao farm and adjacent cattle pasture-forest mosaic. Sloth density was threefold higher in pasture compared with cacao, whereas home range size and overlap were greater in cacao compared with pasture. Dispersal rates were similar between the two habitats, as estimated using ABC procedures applied to the spatial distribution of pairs of related individuals identified using 3,431 single nucleotide polymorphism and 11 microsatellite locus genotypes. Our results indicate that crops produced under a sparse overstorey can, in some cases, constitute lower-quality habitat than pasture-forest mosaics for sloths, perhaps because of differences in food resources or predator communities. Finally, our study demonstrates that integrating field-based demographic approaches with genomic methods can provide a powerful means for characterizing habitat quality for animal populations occurring in heterogeneous landscapes."
449632900006,GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION,"Carbon and Hydrogen Isotope Fractionation of Benzene, Toluene, and o-Xylene during Chemical Oxidation by Persulfate","Experiments were performed to investigate the carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of benzene, toluene, and o-xylene (BTX) during chemical oxidation by unactivated persulfate at two concentrations (8 and 20 g/L). Carbon enrichment (epsilon(C)) values of -1.7 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for benzene, -0.64 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for toluene and -0.36 +/- 0.04 parts per thousand for o-xylene were obtained. No significant hydrogen enrichment (epsilon(H)) was observed for benzene, while the hydrogen enrichment for toluene and o-xylene were -20 +/- 3 parts per thousand and -23 +/- 2 parts per thousand, respectively. The dual isotope plot (Delta delta C-13 vs. Delta delta H-2) for benzene and o-xylene revealed a distinct fractionation trend compared to the majority of the biodegradation data compiled from the literature; however, no unique trend was observed for toluene. The significant carbon and/or hydrogen enrichment, and the distinct trend observed on the dual isotope plot suggest that compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) can potentially be used to monitor the chemical oxidation of BTX by persulfate, and to distinguish treatment areas where persulfate or biodegradation reactions are occurring for benzene and o-xylene."

The test findings showed that the samples do not only have different shades of red but also mechanical properties. The unloaded ultrasound examination of samples was also performed. 31 rock samples were exposed to compression test. The influence of the explosion-based mining technology on mechanical properties of the rocks was identified. The findings of experimental research of the rock sound velocity dependence on rock compression were presented. The research findings can be applied in diagnostics of construction elements made of natural stone in the course of installation.
486146500024,EUROPEAN UROLOGY FOCUS,"Longitudinal Changes in Serum Levels of Testosterone and Luteinizing Hormone in Testicular Cancer Patients after Orchiectomy Alone or Bleomycin, Etoposide, and Cisplatin","Background: Controversy exists whether Leydig cells recover after testicular cancer (TC) treatment or whether premature hormonal aging will occur. Objective: Evaluate serial changes in total testosterone (TT) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in patients treated with orchiectomy alone (Stage I) or combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). Design, settings, and participants: Changes in TT and LH were investigated during 5-yr follow-up (Stage I: n = 75, BEP: n = 81). A selected group of TC patients with mild Leydig cell dysfunction (LH >= 8 IU/l) were followed for a longer period (Stage I: n = 20, BEP: n = 23). An age-matched control group of 839 healthy men served as controls for TT and LH levels. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Changes in age-adjusted TT and LH were evaluated separately in each treatment group with univariate linear regression analysis. The proportion of patients initiating testosterone substitution during follow-up was calculated. Results and limitations: In the 75 Stage I patients there were no significant changes in LH and TT, while in the 81 BEP treated patients there was a significant decline in LH during follow-up (-24.2 percentage point/yr, 95% confidence interval: -38.5 to -9.9, p = 0.001). In total, 11% of Stage I patients and 15% of BEP-treated patients initiated testosterone substitution. In the 23 BEP-treated patients withmild Leydig cell dysfunction there was a significant decline in age-adjusted TT (-0.9 percentage point/yr, 95% confidence interval: -1.8 to -0.04, p = 0.04), while in the 20 Stage I patients there were no significant changes in age-adjusted LH and TT. Limitations include the retrospective study design. Conclusions: TT remained stable during 5-yr follow-up in TC patients treated with orchiectomy alone or BEP. BEP-treated patients with mild Leydig cell dysfunction during follow-up were at risk of long-term testicular failure and evaluation of Leydig cell function beyond follow-up should be considered in this group of patients. Patient summary: This study shows that the majority of testicular cancer survivors had stable testosterone levels after treatment for testicular cancer. However, 11-15% of patients needed testosterone substitution after treatment. (C) 2016 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
438903100007,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY,Horizontally Polarized Antenna for Calibration of a Multiple Probe Antennas Measurement System,"The accurate calibration of a multiple probe antennas measurement system (MPAMS) is an essential requirement for ensuring reliable wireless terminals over the air measurement. Dipole and horizontally polarized (HP) dipole arrays are commonly used as calibration antennas for the MPAMS. In order to improve the calibration accuracy of the MPAMS, a horizontally polarized omnidirectional calibration antenna with a highly symmetric pattern is presented in this paper. The proposed antenna consists of four identical arc-shaped printed dipoles, rotationally placed on the front and back of the substrate. A tapered balun integrates with parallel strip lines transforming impedance matching from unbalance to balance. Dimension of the feeding network is reduced by introducing the Archimedes spiral tapered balun. As a result, the proposed antenna has a reduced size of 52.4 mm x 52.4 mm x 1 mm. The measurement results show that the proposed antenna has -10 dB return loss operating bandwidth of 2.4-2.53 GHz (about 5% bandwidth), a good omnidirectional performance with gain variation in azimuth being less than 0.2 dB, and the cross-polarization ratio in azimuth is larger than 20 dB for each frequency; meanwhile, the farthest apparent phase center point is about 0.3 mm from the geometric center, which is almost coincident with the geometric center."
439480400010,INTERNAL MEDICINE,A Patient with Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Complicated by Multiple Myeloma,"A 68-year-old woman with liver dysfunction was diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) stage 1. Three years later, she showed massive ascites and jaundice. A trans-jugular liver biopsy confirmed advanced cirrhosis, suggesting that her liver fibrosis had progressed rapidly. At the same time, she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM). In this case, the plasma levels of osteopontin (OPN), a proinflammatory cytokine that promotes liver fibrosis progression through the hedgehog pathway and is increased in patients with MM, were increased. This increased OPN expression was accompanied by the upregulation of the hedgehog pathway in this patient, suggesting that the MM-associated increase in OPN had promoted the progression of liver fibrosis through the hedgehog pathway. The progression of liver fibrosis should be monitored in patients with NASH if other diseases, such as MM, are present."
435944700021,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH,"Inferring Geothermal Reservoir Processes at the Raft River Geothermal Field, Idaho, USA, Through Modeling InSAR-Measured Surface Deformation","Ground surface deformations detected with interferometric synthetic aperture radar provide valuable information for inferring subsurface reservoir processes that are difficult to observe directly. This study aims at building a reservoir model that honors the available geological, hydrological, and geomechanical data and also produces ground surface deformation consistent with interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements at the Raft River Geothermal Field. In the thermo-hydro-mechanical coupled model developed, the reservoir deforms as a result of the rock's poroelastic response to changes in hydrologic pressure and thermal expansion/contraction. The results indicate that the observed deformation is the result of pressure decrease in the deep production reservoir and pressure increase in a shallower reservoir that accommodates the injected fluid (likely in the Salt Lake Formation). The combination of the uplift around injection wells with subsidence around the production wells, affected by the Bridge Fault as a flow barrier, creates a complex pattern of surface deformation in which the center of subtle subsidence significantly deviates from the location of the production wells. A parametric study suggests that (a) the Bridge Fault Zone is likely a flow barrier, (b) the surface deformation appears to be insensitive to the presence of the Narrows Structure, and (c) additional flow barriers likely exist to shape the flow system. This case study demonstrates the utility of a high-fidelity forward model that honors available known information and thermo-hydro-mechanical coupled processes in understanding geothermal reservoir characteristics."
445695400003,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,Bottlenose dolphins can understand their partner's role in a cooperative task,"In recent decades, a number of studies have examined whether various non-human animals understand their partner's role in cooperative situations. Yet the relatively tolerant timing requirements of these tasks make it theoretically possible for animals to succeed by using simple behavioural strategies rather than by jointly intended coordination. Here we investigated whether bottlenose dolphins could understand a cooperative partner's role by testing whether they could learn a button-pressing task requiring precise behavioural synchronization. Specifically, members of cooperative dyads were required to swim across a lagoon and each press their own underwater button simultaneously (within a 1 s time window), whether sent together or with a delay between partners of 1-20 s. We found that dolphins were able to work together with extreme precision even when they had to wait for their partner, and that their coordination improved over the course of the study, with the time between button presses in the latter trials averaging 370 ms. These findings show that bottlenose dolphins can learn to understand their partner's role in a cooperative situation, and suggest that the behavioural synchronization evident in wild dolphins' synchronous movement and coordinated alliance displays may be a generalized cognitive ability that can also be used to solve novel cooperative tasks."

Our recent study demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency in early life disturbed testicular development. This study investigated the effects of vitamin D deficiency in early life on prostatic hyperplasia in middle-aged mice. In control group, dams and their male pups were fed with standard-chow diets. In VDD group, dams were fed with vitamin D deficient (VDD) diets throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, male pups continued to be fed with VDD diets. As expected, prostate weight was elevated and prostatic hyperplasia was observed in VDD-fed mice. The number of prostatic Ki-67-positive epithelial cells, a proliferation marker, was increased in VDD-fed mice. Further analysis found that vitamin D deficiency promoted inflammatory infiltration and stromal fibrosis in prostate of middle-aged mice. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency activated NF-kappa B and up-regulated n-6 mRNA in prostate of middle-aged mice. In addition, vitamin D deficiency activated prostatic STAT3, a proliferation pathway in middle-aged mice. Of interest, VDD-induced prostatic inflammation and hyperplasia were partially reversed when VDD diets was replaced with standard diets. These results provide evidence that vitamin D deficiency in early life promotes prostatic hyperplasia in middle-aged mice through exacerbating local inflammation."

The WMS possesses a unique wrinkled structure with conical shaped pores radiating from the center to the surface of each particle. Lanthanum oxide was supported on wrinkled mesoporous silica as a hard template for the synthesis of graphitic carbon. The resulting carbon material retains the unique wrinkled structure and has high surface area (similar to 879 m(2)/g) as well as graphitic walls which were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The amount of La loaded onto the silica support plays a key role in the formation of the mechanically and chemically stable carbon material.

454378800090,LAND USE POLICY,Using the politicized IAD framework to assess integrated forest management decision-making in Slovakia,"Developments in the past 20 years have changed both the context and the goals of forest management in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries in general and Slovakia in particular. One might therefore wonder if introduced ""integrative"" forestry paradigms on the national level are able to provide assimilation of different forest management claims and what are the drivers behind these developments. Analysis of forest management and its context therefore requires a multilevel approach including decision-making at higher institutional levels down to the decisions of local natural resources users. In this paper, we use a politicized Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework that can link various institutional levels and allows for the simultaneous evaluation of a broad context of forest management decision making and its outcome. The research problem is addressed by means of case studies and a qualitative methodology. The results of 50 in-depth interviews with forest managers, owners, and other actors revealed that both the role of power and institutional setup are the core drivers of the socioecological outcome. Although the behavior and relationship of forest managers and owners in various networks vary, it is against this background that distinct forest management approaches are employed. Each approach delivers a similar set of ecosystem services. As timber is the main source of income, the provisioning services have primary importance. Thus, an integration of various forest management claims is challenging due to current forestry paradigms and the amount of resources available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
419818800008,SMALL,"Na-Cation-Assisted Exfoliation of MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) Nanosheets in an Aqueous Medium with the Aid of a Polymeric Surfactant for Flexible Polymer-Nanocomposite Memory Applications","2D nanosheets of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been attracting attention due to their sizable band gap. Facile and effective Na-cation-assisted exfoliation of TMDC (MX2, M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) nanosheets in an aqueous medium and their application as a composite filler in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix are explored in this work. The presence of Na cations is highly beneficial for exfoliating defect-free and few-layer MX2 nanosheets in water in the presence of small-sized micelles of polymeric surfactant, and significantly elevates the exfoliation yield by more than one order of magnitude compared to a conventional surfactant-assisted exfoliation. The strategy suggested in this work is very advantageous compared to both Li cation intercalation in organic solvents and conventional low-yield surfactant-assisted exfoliations. As an application of the exfoliated nanosheets, the fabrication of memory devices with the configuration of Ga-doped ZnO/MX2-PVA/Ag is demonstrated, and they exhibit bistable and write-once-read-many-times resistive switching behavior with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 3 x 10(3) at -1.0 V (for WS2) and 2.0 V (for MoS2). Furthermore, MX2-PVA nanocomposite fibrous films and mats are successfully fabricated using an electrospinning technique, which can expand the use of TMDC nanofillers in applications involving highly flexible polymer-based MX2 composites."

The 2011/2012 Spanish National Health Survey (n = 21,650) and the 2014 National Health Survey of the Spanish Roma Population (n = 1167) were analyzed. Use of healthcare services was measured in terms of visits to a general practitioner (GP), visits to an emergency department, and hospitalizations. Healthcare need was measured using (a) self-rated health and (b) the reported number of chronic diseases. The Roma reported worse self-rated health and a higher prevalence of chronic diseases. A redistributive effect (increased healthcare service use among Roma and those in lower socio-economic classes) was found for hospitalizations and emergency visits. This effect was also observed in GP visits for women, but not for men. Vertical inequity was observed in the general population but not in the Roma population for GP visits. The results suggest the existence of horizontal inequity in the use of GP services (Roma women), emergency department visits (Roma and general population), and hospitalizations (Roma population) and of vertical inequity in the use of GP services among the general population."

These carbons have been shown to consist largely of amorphous carbon with some spherical and flake-like conglomerates. Functionalised oxygen has been observed in synthesised carbons using FTIR and XPS. Synthesised carbons have been investigated in 3-electrode cells and analysed using cyclic voltammetry and step potential electrochemical spectroscopy (SPECS) at room temperature. Capacitances as high as 450 F g(-1) have been observed at 0.0833 mV s(-1) scan rates. The EDLC and pseudo-capacitive behaviour of produced carbons have been analysed and it has been found that the produced carbons behave hybrid capacitors with considerable pseudo-capacitive contributions. The performance of synthesised carbons has been compared to that of activated carbon derived through the chemical activation of carbon from the pyrolysis of coconut husks and to the reported capacitances of commercial activated carbons.

In this paper, we determine their dimension and we prove that they are all irreducible. This is in contrast with the nonstructured case, since it is known that the set of n x n matrix pencils with rank at most r < n is an algebraic set with r + 1 irreducible components. We also show that these sets of structured pencils with bounded rank are the closure of the congruence orbit of a certain structured pencil given in canonical form. This allows us to determine the generic canonical form of a structured n x n matrix pencil with rank at most r, for any of the previous structures."

Due to its size dependent refractive index, Silicon (Si) nanocrystal is used as nonlinear medium in the proposed ADC. Coding system of optical ADC is based on successive-like approximations which requires only one quantization level to represent each single bit, despite of conventional ADCs that require at least two distinct levels for each bit. Each is representing bit of optical ADC is formed by vertically alignment of double rings of OSPCRRs (DR-OSPCRR) and cascading in number of DR-OSPCRR, forms an in bit ADC. Investigating different parameters of DR-OSPCRR such as refractive indices of rings, lattice refractive index, and coupling coefficients of waveguideto-ring and ring-to-ring, the ADC's threshold power is tuned. Increasing the number of bits of ADC, increases the overall power consumption of ADC. One can arrange to have any number of bits for this ADC, as long as the power levels are treated carefully. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) in-house codes were used to evaluate the ADC's effectiveness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
439353200001,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE,Towards a versatile and multidimensional framework to analyse regional governance,"Regional governance has received growing attention, not only from researchers, but also from politicians and practitioners of regional development. The understanding and usage of the concept, however, are highly heterogeneous: sometimes regional governance is described or explained in terms of its characteristics, processes and impacts, while at other times, it is framed as a tool for regional development. This article develops a definition and framework for a systematic assessment of various regional governance forms. For this purpose, it draws on material from a three-round Delphi survey among practitioners and researchers who are experts of regional governance. On this basis, a consolidated definition of regional governance is proposed as the vertical and horizontal coordination of regional transformation processes beyond administrative boundaries by state and non-state actors'. Furthermore, the framework identifies five dimensions of regional governance: (a) participation, (b) bindingness, (c) formalisation, (d) regional autonomy and (e) power relations. These dimensions are disaggregated into a total of 21 indicators to systematically describe and analyse different regional governance forms."
438284000016,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL CHEMISTRY,An optimal scheme for multiple roots of nonlinear equations with eighth-order convergence,"We have a good number of eighth-order iterative methods for simple zeros of nonlinear equations in the available literature. But, unfortunately, we don't have a single iterative method of eighth-order for multiple zeros with known or unknown multiplicity. Some scholars from the worldwide have tried to present optimal or non-optimal multipoint eighth-order iteration functions. But, unfortunately, none of them get success in this direction and attained maximum sixth-order convergence in the case of multiple zeros with known multiplicity m. Motivated and inspired by this fact, we propose an optimal scheme with eighth-order convergence based on weight function approach. In addition, an extensive convergence study is discussed in order to demonstrate the eighth-order convergence of the present scheme. Moreover, we also show the applicability of our scheme on some real life and academic problems. These problems illustrate that our methods are more efficient among the available multiple root finding techniques."

The heat-treated (600 degrees C) Pt-Mo/C catalyst showed higher hydrogen oxidation activity in the absence and in the presence of CO and better stability, compared to all other Mo-containing catalysts. PtMoRuFe, PtMoFe, PtMoRu supported on carbon and Pt supported on Mo2C/C exhibited similar CO tolerances but better stability, as compared to as-prepared PtMo supported on carbon. Among the tungsten-based catalysts, tungsten carbide supported Pt catalyst showed reasonable performance and reliable stability in comparison to simple carbon supported PtW catalyst, though an uneven level of catalytic activity towards H-2 oxidation in presence of CO is observed for the former as compared to Mo containing catalyst. However, a small dissolution of Mo, Ru, Fe and W from the anodes and their migration toward cathodes during the cell operation is observed. These results indicate that the fuel cell performance and stability has been improved but not yet totally resolved."

Here we report the crystal structures of the yeast Debaryomyces nepalensis xylose reductase (DnXR, AKR2B10) in the apo form and as a ternary complex with a novel NADP-DTT adduct. Xylose reductase, a key enzyme in the conversion of xylose to xylitol, has several industrial applications. The enzyme displayed the highest catalytic efficiency for L-threose (138 +/- 7 mM(-1).s(-1)) followed by D-erythrose (30 +/- 3 mM(-1).s(-1)). The crystal structure of the complex reveals a covalent linkage between the C4N atom of the nicotinamide ring of the cosubstrate and the S1 sulfur atom of DTT and provides the first structural evidence for a protein mediated NADP-low-molecular-mass thiol adduct. We hypothesize that the formation of the adduct is facilitated by an in-crystallo Michael addition of the DTT thiolate to the specific conformation of bound NADPH in the active site of DnXR. The interactions between DTT, a four-carbon sugar alcohol analog, and the enzyme are representative of a near-cognate product ternary complex and provide significant insights into the structural basis of aldose binding and specificity and the catalytic mechanism of ARs."

The deposited InN QDs were of the order of 5-50 nm in diameter with density similar to 7 x 10(9)/cm(2) . The synthesized InN QDs were nearly single crystalline, confirmed from the diffraction peak in the < 110 > direction. Photoluminescence (PL) measurement showed peak emission at similar to 1138 nm (1.08 eV) at 19 K. The PL emission energy exhibited blue shift and the intensity reduced with an increase in temperature. The high optical band gap emission of the InN QDs is possibly due to energy level quantization resulted from size reduction. The free carrier concentration was found to be similar to 2 x 10(18) cm(-3). The device selectively detected the 1080 nm (1.13 eV) wavelength with maximum responsivity near the optical band edge at 10 K and room temperature (300 K) respectively.

The screening procedure led to the selection of the New Caledonian endemic species Meiogyne baillonii for a chemical investigation. Using a bioguided isolation procedure, three enediyne-gamma-butyrolactones (1-3) and two enediyne-gamma-butenolides (4 and 5), named sapranthins H-L, respectively, two enediyne carboxylic acid (6 and 7), two depsidones, stictic acid (8) and baillonic acid (9), aristolactams Ala and Alia (10 and 11), and two aporphines, dehydroroemerine (12) and noraristolodione (13), were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the bark. The structures of the new compounds (1-6, 9, and 11) and their relative configurations were established by NMR spectroscopic analysis and by X-ray diffraction analysis for compound 9. Only stictic acid (8) exhibited a significant inhibiting activity of the RhoA-p115 complex, with an EC50 value of 0.19 +/- 0.05 mM. This is the first time that a natural inhibitor of the complex RhoA-p115's activity was discovered from an HTS performed over a collection of higher plant extracts. Thus, stictic acid (8) could be used as the first reference compound inhibiting the interaction between RhoA and p115."

This exploratory subanalysis examines 6- and 12-month outcomes among CPIC participants aged >50 years. Design: Community-partnered, cluster-randomized trial conducted between April 2010 and March 2012. Setting: Hollywood-Metropolitan (HM) and South Los Angeles (SLA) Service Planning Areas (SPAs), Los Angeles, California Participants: 394 participants aged >50 years with depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire score >= 10). Intervention: A community-partnered multi-sector coalition approach (Community Engagement and Planning [CEP]) vs individual program technical assistance (Resources for Services [RS]) to implement depression collaborative care. Main Outcome Measures: Depressive symptoms (PHQ-8 score), mental health-related quality of life (MHRQL), community-prioritized outcomes including mental wellness, homelessness risk and physical activity, and services utilization. Results: At 6 months, CEP was more effective than RS at improving MHRQL and mental wellness among participants aged >50 years; no differences were found in the effects of CEP vs RS on other outcomes. No significant outcome differences between CEP and RS were found at 12 months. Conclusions: A multisector community coalition approach may offer additional benefits over individual program technical assistance to improve outcomes among depressed adults aged >50 years living in underserved communities."
449048900029,LANCET,Quantifying the burden of stillbirths before 28 weeks of completed gestational age in high-income countries: a population-based study of 19 European countries,"Background International comparisons of stillbirth allow assessment of variations in clinical practice to reduce mortality. Currently, such comparisons include only stillbirths from 28 or more completed weeks of gestational age, which underestimates the true burden of stillbirth. With increased registration of early stillbirths in high-income countries, we assessed the reliability of including stillbirths before 28 completed weeks in such comparisons. Methods In this population-based study, we used national cohort data from 19 European countries participating in the Euro-Peristat project on livebirths and stillbirths from 22 completed weeks of gestation in 2004, 2010, and 2015. We excluded countries without national data for stillbirths by gestational age in these periods, or where data available were not comparable between 2004 and 2015. We also excluded those countries with fewer than 10 000 births per year because the proportion of stillbirths at 22 weeks to less than 28 weeks of gestation is small. We calculated pooled stillbirth rates using a random-effects model and changes in rates between 2004 and 2015 using risk ratios (RR) by gestational age and country. Findings Stillbirths at 22 weeks to less than 28 weeks of gestation accounted for 32% of all stillbirths in 2015. The pooled stillbirth rate at 24 weeks to less than 28 weeks declined from 0.97 to 0.70 per 1000 births from 2004 to 2015, a reduction of 25% (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.85). The pooled stillbirth rate at 22 weeks to less than 24 weeks of gestation in 2015 was 0.53 per 1000 births and did not significantly changed over time (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80-1.16) although changes varied widely between countries (RRs 0.62-2.09). Wide variation in the percentage of all births occurring at 22 weeks to less than 24 weeks of gestation suggest international differences in ascertainment. Interpretation Present definitions used for international comparisons exclude a third of stillbirths. International consistency of reporting stillbirths at 24 weeks to less than 28 weeks suggests these deaths should be included in routinely reported comparisons. This addition would have a major impact, acknowledging the burden of perinatal death to families, and making international assessments more informative for clinical practice and policy. Ascertainment of fetal deaths at 22 weeks to less than 24 weeks should be stabilised so that all stillbirths from 22 completed weeks of gestation onwards can be reliably compared.

427025300005,ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,Near-source strong motion database catalog for Iran,"This paper discusses a newly developed high-quality integrated dataset of shallow earthquake ground motions that occurred in Iran, from 1976 to 2013. A total of 860 three-component strong motion records are processed from 183 earthquake events, moment magnitudes 5.0 <= M-w <= 7.4, and rupture distances of R-RUP <= 120 km. Strong motion data from Iran having special tectonic features and shallow earthquakes with depths less than 35 km are included. This paper presents a thorough procedure used to collect and to generate a database following the Next-Generation Attenuation-West research projects. This database can be used in the development and ranking of ground motion models and for seismological and engineering hazard and risk analyses. Unprocessed strong motion records are obtained from the Iranian Strong Motion Network (ISMN). The time series collected were thoroughly examined through several rounds of quality reviews. The newly generated database includes the peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and pseudo-spectral acceleration for the 5% damped with periods ranging from 0.01 to 10 s. The database also includes ground motion information and source characterization and parameters. This study is the near-source compiled ground motion database that can be used for Iran, and it is consistent with standard worldwide databases."
452610000003,JOURNAL OF AEROSOL MEDICINE AND PULMONARY DRUG DELIVERY,Assessment of the Power Required for Optimal Use of Current Inhalation Devices,"Background: Inhalation of medications is the cornerstone in the treatment of patients with lung diseases. A variety of inhalation devices exists and each device has specific requirements to achieve optimum inhalation of the drug. The goal of this study was to establish a clear overview on performance requirements of standard inhalation devices that should be met by the patient's breathing power and to develop a new method to measure the individual performance data. Materials and Methods: An optimum and still acceptable required breathing power (P in watts) was calculated for each device with the aid of individual device flow rates (determined by a literature search) and the flow resistances (by measuring the pressure drop over the different inhalation devices). For the in vivo part of the study, peak inspiratory flow and peak inspiratory pressure drop were measured in 21 adult patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and healthy volunteers and the peak inspiratory power (PIPO in watts) was calculated. Results: Nearly no power is needed to achieve optimum results when using pressurized metered dose inhalers. For dry powder inhalers, the required power depends on the specific inhalation device. Conclusions: Inhalation devices impose differing demands on the inspiratory breathing power of patients. To ensure adequate use of the different devices, a cheap and simple assessment of patients' PIPO may be one option."
444681100005,PLOS ONE,Economic burden of the therapeutic management of mental illnesses and its effect on household purchasing power,"Cost or burden of illness studies for mental illnesses has helped define the magnitude of their negative effects on the household, community and national economy. Despite its many benefits, there is a paucity of these studies among Nigerians being managed for mental illnesses. This study was aimed at assessing the economic burden of mental illnesses and its effect on household purchasing power. The study was descriptive cross-sectional in design conducted among 284 out-patients with five categories of mental illnesses at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Aro recruited via a systematic sampling technique. Data collection was quantitative using a semi-structured interviewer-administered tool. Participants provided the actual direct costs and estimates of indirect costs incurred during their most recent inpatient admission and their first clinic visit after discharge. Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were conducted on the direct and estimated indirect costs respectively after testing them for normality using the Q-Q plot with statistical significance determined at p<0.05. Almost 96% of respondents finance their healthcare costs by themselves or their family with >50% earning US$1.8 per day. Their mean direct and estimated indirect costs were (US $23.1 +/- US$11.3 and US$15 +/- US$28). There were no statistically significant differences in the mean direct and estimated indirect costs incurred by participants across the categories of mental illnesses. A significantly higher proportion of participants could afford the essential goods (88%) compared to those who could afford luxurious goods (29%) with p<0.001. The mean direct costs incurred by those who could afford the essential and luxurious goods were significantly higher than those who could not following a t-test. The median estimated indirect costs incurred by those who could not afford luxurious goods differed significantly from those who could with the Mann Whitney U-test. Participants with mental illnesses face a high economic burden in managing their condition with the majority unable to afford luxurious goods. Affordability was also associated with incurring more direct costs."
437355200005,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER,Dasatinib sensitises KRAS-mutant cancer cells to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor via inhibition of TAZ activity,"Purpose: Oncogenic KRAS mutations occur frequently in solid tumours, but no clinically applicable targeted strategy is yet available for treating human cancers with mutant KRAS. Here we aimed to identify a strategy for the treatment of KRAS-driven cancers. Experimental Design: Cell viability and colony forming assays were used to assess the in vitro effect of dasatinib and trametinib as single agents or in combination. Western blot was used to analyse the phosphorylated protein and total protein levels. Xenograft models were used to evaluate the in vivo effect of drug combination on KRAS-driven tumour growth. Results: Here, we report the discovery of a synergistic interaction between dasatinib (ABL and SRC family kinase inhibitor) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor trametinib in KRAS-mutant cancer cells. We demonstrated that dasatinib enhanced the antitumour effect of trametinib against the KRAS-mutant cancer models both in vitro and in vivo, and the combination resulted in a significant reduction of cytoplasmic and nucleic TAZ protein level, and therefore decreased downstream protein levels of YAP/TAZ signalling pathway. Furthermore, direct knockdown of TAZ by small interfering RNA was able to increase the sensitivity of KRAS-mutant cells to trametinib treatment. Conclusion: These results indicate that dasatinib enhances the antitumour activity of MEK inhibitor through inhibition of TAZ activity and identify dasatinib and trametinib combination as a potential strategy for the treatment of KRAS-driven cancers.

446286400107,CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS,The hydration and microstructure characteristics of cement pastes with high volume organic-contaminated waste glass powder,"This study investigates the influence of the organic-contaminated waste glass powder-filter glass on cement hydration and the microstructure characteristics of the hydration products. In order to study the influences of organic contamination, treated (washed) glass powder was used as reference addition. The incorporation of filter glass powder results in longer induction periods and lower reaction intensity compared to the samples with washed glass. The addition of chemical accelerators such as CaCl2, nanosilica and microsilica can significantly improve the hydration of samples containing high volumes of filter glass powder. The organic contamination shows a negligible effect in terms of hydration products identified by XRD analysis. In mixtures with high volume filter glass powder (70%), the formation of calcium hydroxide was delayed at 3 and 7 days. Samples containing more than 50% waste glass present a higher pore volume in pore sizes lower than 15 nm and lower pore volume between 20 and 50 nm. It was observed from the SEM analysis that the organic contamination may slow the pozzolanic reaction of glass particles in mixes with 70% filter glass. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Our system includes a cache with fixed size m, and we characterize the relationship between the parameter m and the class of graphs that can be produced through the graph-theoretic concept of tree decomposition. We find empirically that small cache sizes cover a high percentage of sentences in existing semantic corpora."
431944100006,ANNALS OF ANIMAL SCIENCE,NEW POLYMORPHIC CHANGES IN THE WNT7A GENE AND THEIR EFFECT ON REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS IN PIGS,"For many years, research has been undertaken to identify genetic markers associated with reproductive traits in pigs, but these issues are still open to research. WNT7A expression was found in endometrium during embryo implantation as well as in early pregnancy in humans and in different species of animals. Our study was designed to identify polymorphic changes in the WNT7A gene and their effect on reproductive traits in 480 Polish Large White (PLW) and Polish Landrace (PL) pigs in 4 successive litters. As a result, 3 mutations were identified: two transitions in exon 3 g. 6270G>A (rs326274214) and in intron 4 g. 36251G>A (rs321204163) and deletion/insertion in intron 4 g. 36220delinsAT (rs338143418). Frequency analysis of the genotypes of these polymorphisms in the WNT7A gene showed departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for PLW at locus g. 36220delinsAT and for total breeds and PLW at locus g. 36251G>A. Generally, the largest litters were found in sows with AA genotypes for mutations g. 6270G> A and g. 36251G>A and in sows with ins/ins genotype for mutation g. 3622delinsAT. However, the sows of these genotypes formed only a small percentage (from 9% to 13%) in the studied group of animals. Statistical analysis showed significant differences only for the number of piglets born and reared in parity 1 (1NBA and 1N21d) in favor of the sows with genotype AA g. 6270G> A (P <= 0.05) and for the number of piglets born in litter 4 (4NBA) with genotype ins/ins g. 3622delinsAT (P <= 0.05). The analysed mutations had no effect on the age at first farrowing and the successive farrowing intervals."

This study aims to evaluate the microbiological vulnerability of eggs and environmental conditions in a farm certified for both conventional and free-range systems using two standard methods (enterobacteria counting and Salmonella spp. survey). Two high-producing farms were selected for this study, one under both conventional and free-range systems at the same place as the test farm, and another under conventional system only as a control farm. Enterobacteriaceae counts were determined for eggshells; and detection of Salmonella spp. was conducted in eggs, nest box material, feeder, and sponge samples from water dispensers, feeders, production plant, besides water samples from nipple dispensers and artesian well. The average enterobacteria count (log CFUmL(-1)) was 0.09 for conventional and 1.73 for free-range systems (p < 0.001). While Salmonella spp. was not detected in the conventional system but was present in one feeder and three eggshells from the free-range system. Therefore, the conventional system demonstrated better hygiene-sanitary status than the free-range one. Moreover, controlling food safety should always be considered when improving animal welfare."
439796700020,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,Differential response to heat stress in outer and inner onion bulb scales,"The formation of brown protective skin in onion bulbs can be induced by rapid post-harvest heat treatment. Onions that are peeled to different depths and are exposed to heat stress show that only the outer scales form the dry brown skin, whereas the inner scales maintain high water content and do not change color. Our study demonstrates that browning of the outer scale during heat treatment is due to an enzymatic process that is associated with high levels of oxidation components, such as peroxidase and quercetin glucoside. De novo transcriptome analysis revealed differential molecular responses of the outer and inner scales to heat stress. Genes involved in lipid metabolism, oxidation pathways, and cell-wall modification were highly expressed in the outer scale during heating. Defense response-related genes such as those encoding heat-shock proteins, antioxidative stress defense, or production of osmoprotectant metabolites were mostly induced in the inner scale in response to heat exposure. These transcriptomic data led to a conceptual model that suggests sequential processes for the development of browning and desiccation of the outer scale versus processes associated with defense response and heat tolerance in the inner scales."

429757600042,ENERGY AND BUILDINGS,Integrated life cycle cost method for sustainable structural design by focusing on a benchmark office building in Australia,"Cost has been traditionally known as a key factor that needs to be considered in the decision making process. Recent awareness in environmental problems has highlighted the need for considering environmental impacts into the process of making choices. However, far too little attention has been paid to reflect the environmental impact and the building cost into the decision making process. As such, this study proposed a method that integrates and considers the environmental cost and building cost in the structural design process. This method takes into account the cost associated with building materials, construction methods and amount of embodied carbon emission during the life cycle of buildings. The current study analysed the effects of two construction systems (Flat slab and waffle slab) and two structural materials (Normal concrete and Ultra-lightweight concrete) on overall costs of a typical high rise concrete structure (15-story office building) in Australia (NS11401.1 2014). The results show that the office building designed with lightweight construction method (waffle slab) and normal concrete (Normal weight) has a lower life cycle cost (50 year lifespan) in comparison with the other design alternatives. It was found that an appropriate selecting of construction forms and type of concrete can save up to 7% of the cost of material consumption, 5% of the total energy consumption expense, and 5% of the CO2-e emissions of the building across all five major cities. This study demonstrates a method to quantify the potential impact of Ultra-lightweight concrete has on the life cycle cost and carbon emissions of commercial buildings. The proposed methodology to assess life cycle cost and environmental impact can be used as a supporting tool in selection of efficient construction methods and structural materials over the lifetime of building.

424426000010,JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION,An algorithmic approach to construct D-optimal saturated designs for logistic model,"In this paper, locally D-optimal saturated designs for a logistic model with one and two continuous input variables have been constructed by modifying the famous Fedorov exchange algorithm. A saturated design not only ensures the minimum number of runs in the design but also simplifies the row exchange computation. The basic idea is to exchange a design point with a point from the design space. The algorithm performs the best row exchange between design points and points form a candidate set representing the design space. Naturally, the resultant designs depend on the candidate set. For gain in precision, intuitively a candidate set with a larger number of points and the low discrepancy is desirable, but it increases the computational cost. Apart from the modification in row exchange computation, we propose implementing the algorithm in two stages. Initially, construct a design with a candidate set of affordable size and then later generate a new candidate set around the points of design searched in the former stage. In order to validate the optimality of constructed designs, we have used the general equivalence theorem. Algorithms for the construction of optimal designs have been implemented by developing suitable codes in R."
428787600002,NANOSCALE,Ultrathin silver telluride nanowire films and gold nanosheet electrodes for a flexible resistive switching device,"We demonstrated a flexible resistive switching device based on ultrathin Ag2Te nanowire (NW) films and Au nanosheet (NS) electrodes by exploiting a monolayer assembly on the water surface for macroscale two-dimensional structures. Firstly, ultrathin TeNWs (diameter approximate to 10 nm) are rapidly assembled on the water surface as a form of monolayer and transferred to fabricate TeNW films on various substrates with any available size. An assembled TeNW film was used as a template to produce a Ag2TeNW film through chemical transformation. A well-aligned Ag2TeNW film device showed reversible resistive switching properties when the Ag composition of the silver telluride NW becomes stoichiometric Ag2Te. Additionally, a non-stoichiometric Ag2+delta TeNW film shows an increased On/Off ratio. For a flexible memory device, ultrathin AuNSs (thickness <= 20 nm) were adopted as working electrodes, since thermally deposited gold electrodes tend to crack under strain, which can fail to maintain the electrical properties. A paper-like flexibility of AuNS proved its capability as optimal electrodes of ultrathin Ag2TeNW film-based resistive memory devices."
424914800007,HORMONE RESEARCH IN PAEDIATRICS,Initial Presentation of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents Predicts Durability of Successful Treatment with Metformin Monotherapy: Insights from the Pediatric Diabetes Consortium T2D Registry,"Background/Aims: Many adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have rapid deterioration of glycemic control on metformin monotherapy within 2 years of diagnosis. Methods: Enrollment data from the Pediatric Diabetes Consortium T2D Registry were used to categorize 276 youth with a T2D duration >= 2 years into two groups: (1) participants with HbA1c <7.5% on metformin monotherapy (group 1, n = 75) and (2) participants treated with insulin +/- metformin (group 2, n = 201). The characteristics of the groups were compared. Results: At enrollment, groups 1 and 2 did not differ in age (16.2 vs. 16.8 years) or BMI percentile (99 vs. 98%); group 2 had higher HbA1c (9.9% [85 mmol/mol] vs. 5.9% [41 mmol/mol], p < 0.001). Lower HbA(1c) and metformin monotherapy at diagnosis were associated with a greater likelihood of adequate control with metformin alone (p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, HbA1c at diagnosis (p = 0.001) and diabetes duration (p = 0.009) were associated with adequate control on metformin. The HbA1c trajectory after diagnosis was worse in group 2. Conclusion: Durable metabolic control of T2D with metformin monotherapy is most likely in youth presenting with lower HbA(1c) and with shorter diabetes duration, independent of age, race-ethnicity, and BMI. Elevated HbA(1c) levels in those on insulin therapy highlight the importance of early diagnosis and a better understanding of glycemic control barriers. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel"

Neuroinflammation, neurotrophic factors and neuronal recovery factors associated with the neuroprotective effect of this flavonoid require further investigations. Thus, now we investigated the possible involvement of inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophic factors and neuronal recovery in the effect of chrysin in 6-hydroxidopamine (6-OHDA), a well-established model of Parkinson's disease, in striatum of mice. The 6-OHDA microinjection induced behavioral alterations on the rotarod test and apomorphine-induced circling behavior in mice. 6-OHDA administration elevated levels of tumour necrosis factor-a, interferon-gamma, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-2, interleukin-6 and nuclear factor-kappa B and decreased the interleukin-10 levels, total reactive antioxidant potential and total antioxidant reactivity in striatum, as well as, modified the calcium-binding protein B (S100B), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor levels. The intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA also induced an decrease of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanylic acid levels and tyrosine hydroxylase content. Oral treatment with chrysin (10 mg/kg, 28 days), culminated with the prevention of these alterations occasioned by 6-OHDA. These results corroborated with the neuroprotective effect of chrysin in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and, indicated the mechanism involved throught the inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophic factors and recovery of dopaminergic neurons in striatum."
445097100014,INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS,Total ankle replacement leads to high revision rates in post-traumatic end-stage arthrosis,"Introduction Extremely heterogeneous revision rates in total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) of the upper ankle joint are reported and result to heterogeneous collectives and to short follow-up times. The aim is to investigate revision rates and the underlying reasons, as well as treatment outcome and quality of life after TAA in post-traumatic cases with sufficient follow-up. Methods In 2008-2013, 74 patients with post-traumatic arthrosis were treated using TAA with a Tornier Salto prosthesis, and 60 (35 males and 25 females; mean age 56) were followed-up (mean: 59 months; range 24-91 months). Results The revision rate after TAA was 42% (n = 25), and it was 8% after 12 months and 18% after 24 months. Twenty percent of the patients had significant symptomatic periprosthetic bone cysts, 5% had impingement, 3% had soft tissue infections, and, in 14%, revision was caused by other factors. The most commonly performed procedures were cyst debridement and autologous spongy bone grafting (20%). Fifteen percent (n = 9) of the prosthetics were explanted or switched to a tibiotalar arthrodesis (TTA). The mean AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society) score was 55.15 (range 12-100) and the mean FAO (Foot and Ankle Outcome) score was 49.6 (range 18-100). The revision subgroup had impaired outcomes (AOFAS 38.84; FAO 35.5) while the non-revision subgroup had improved outcomes (AOFAS 66.8; FAO 60.48). TAA patients undergoing conversion to TTA had worse outcomes (AOFAS 39; FAO 35.29). Conclusion Total ankle replacement in post-traumatic end-stage arthrosis patients is associated with high revision rates. High rates of symptomatic periprosthetic bone cysts caused high rates of revision surgery and worse outcomes, which were not improved by secondary TTA."

418197800016,JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES,Translocation of Three Historical Buildings in Renovation of the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing,"In order to adapt to a new site planning of the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, China, two two-story and one three-story historical masonry building built in the 1930s were translocated. Because of the limited ground space, the three buildings were divided into eight parts and reconnected after translocation. The moving routes had multiple broken lines to avoid influencing surrounding old trees, and the maximum translocation distance was 184m. Some building units were rotated by 7 degrees or lowered by 4.2m, in accordance with the new site planning. Procedure and technical details of the translocation, including the structural strengthening, load underpinning, structural separation, ground treatment and reconnection, etc., are introduced in this paper. One building was pulled by a traditional hydraulic-jack system with high-strength steel strands; the other two buildings were moved by using a novel translocation device, which is capable of self-walking and turning 360 degrees, in order to change the translocation direction more efficiently. Through the vertical hydraulic jack in this new translocation device, the undesirable difference in column settlements can be automatically compensated, which loosens the requirement on the rail stiffness."

Currently in Malaysia, there is no specific treatment for NH4+-N and Mn2+ in drinking water treatment plant. BAF is a well known system in biological treatment for wastewater but not for drinking water treatment. This study showed that at 24 hours operation of BAF system, about 91.3% of COD, 94.4% of NH4+-N and 83.4% of Mn2+ were efficiently removed. When HRT was decreased to 12 and 6 hours, there was insignificant removal difference in COD and NH4+-N removal. Instead, the Mn2+ removal significantly showed an increasing trend (p<0.05) as the HRT was decreased with the removal percentages of 92.1% (12 hours) and 94.8% (6 hours). Real-time monitoring through pH, ORP and DO profiles confirmed that completed simultaneous NH4+-N and Mn2+ removal occurred within 6 to 7 hours HRT."

We assessed the association between adolescent body mass index (BMI) and ID mortality. METHODS: BMI of 2 294 139 Israeli adolescents (60% men; age 17.4 +/- 0.3 years) was measured between 1967 and 2010. The outcome, obtained by linkage with official national records, was death due to ID as the underlying cause. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were applied. RESULTS: During 42 297 007 person-years of follow-up (median 18.4 years), there were 689 deaths from ID (mean age 44.1 +/- 10.5 years). Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were 1.039 (1.011-1.068) and 1.146 (1.099-1.194) among men and women, respectively, per unit increment in BMI (P for sex interaction 4.4 x 10(-5)). Adjusted hazard ratios among men were 1.2 (1.0-1.5), 1.9 (1.4-2.5) and 2.5 (1.5-1.2) for those with high-normal BMI (22.0-24.9 kg m(-2)), overweight and obese, respectively, compared with the 18.5 <= BMI < 22 kg m(2) reference group, and 1.7 (1.1-2.6), 2.6 (1.6-4.3) and 6.6 (3.3-13.1) among women, respectively. The increased risk among underweight (< 18.5 kg m(-2)) boys was attenuated when the study sample was restricted to those with unimpaired health at baseline. A multivariable spline model indicated a minimum risk for total ID mortality at 20.7 and 18.0 kg m(-2) for men and women, respectively, with significantly increased risk seen above adolescent BMI values of 23.6 and 24.0 kg m(-2), respectively. The association with BMI was particularly evident for bacterial infections (predominantly sepsis), airways and central nervous system infections (63% of the ID deaths). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent overweight and obesity were strongly associated with ID mortality, especially of bacterial origin and among women."

As expected, the more severe suicidality groups reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, traumatic distress, and substance abuse symptoms. Findings support the validity of the BHS and its utility as a medical decision tool to help ED staff evaluate the severity of patients' suicidality."
432235200002,WASTE MANAGEMENT,Downcycling versus recycling of construction and demolition waste: Combining LCA and LCC to support sustainable policy making,"Urgent solutions are needed in Europe to deal with construction and demolition waste (CDW). EU policy has contributed to significantly reducing the amount of CDW going to landfill, but most of the effort has been put in downcycling practices. Therefore, further policies are needed to stimulate high-quality recycling of CDW. The present paper presents a combined life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodologies to analyse the environmental and the economic drivers in four alternative CDW end-of-life scenarios in the region of Flanders, in Belgium. The four analysed alternatives are (i) landfilling, (ii) downcycling, (iii) advanced recycling and (iv) recycling after selective demolition. LCA results show that landifiling is the scenario having the highest environmental impacts in terms of person equivalent (PE), followed by downcycling and recycling (-36%) and recycling after selective demolition (-59%). The decrease in environmental impacts is mostly due to the avoided landfilling of CDW and the recovery of materials from selective demolition. LCC results indicate that landfilling is the scenario bearing the highest total economic costs. This is due to the high landfill tax in Flanders. The recycling after selective demolition bears the second highest cost. The increase of high-quality CDW recycling can significantly reduce the overall environmental impact of the system. Implementing a high landfill tax, increasing the gate fee to the recycling plant, and boosting the sales price of recycled aggregates are the most effective drivers to facilitate a transition towards a more sustainable CDW management system. The paper demonstrates that the combined LCA and LCC results can highlight the environmental and economic drivers in CDW management. The results of the combined analysis can help policymakers to promote the aspects contributing to sustainability and to limit the ones creating a barrier. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
429512700020,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS,Numerical evaluation of time-dependent sagging for low density polyurethane foams to apply the long-term driving comfort on the seat cushion design,"Car seat's bearing capacity, after a person' takes a seat, is time dependent and tend to harden with increased time. Hardening of seat results from viscoelasticity of seat's foam pad, and has a great effect on a person's seating comfort in a long term driving mode. As such, evaluation of changes to bearing capacity is an important design factor that must be considered at the time of the seat design, and need to be evaluated quantitatively. This study intends to apply numerical analysis for quantitative evaluation of the changes to bearing capacity of seat cushions during a long term driving, and evaluate based on different materials of seat foam pads to be used as a reference material during the design. Car seat's comfort functions are divided into static comfort, evaluated in a time domain, and dynamic comfort, evaluated in a vibrating domain. However, as this study only intends to evaluate the seat cushion's hardening effects during a long term driving, we only evaluated the static comfort in a time domain. We assumed the long term driving to be two hours, quantified the hardening level to an amount of sagging, and evaluated three types of low density polyurethane foams with different material characteristics. We applied the analysis method used and verified in the previous research phase to numerically evaluate the amount of sagging depending on the seating time, and tested the foam pad's static compressive behavior and viscoelasticity behavior to acquire data on material's characteristic. In order to consider body's seating position, we used HPM-1 dummy model provided by ESI's PAM-COMFORT (finite-element analysis program exclusively for seat), and compared the amount of sagging. We were able to predict the amount of sagging of each material from the analysis results and confirmed noticeable differences. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V."
441051600013,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL,Robustness and evolvability of heterogeneous cell populations,"Biological systems are endowed with two fundamental but seemingly contradictory properties: robustness, the ability to withstand environmental fluctuations and genetic variability; and evolvability, the ability to acquire selectable and heritable phenotypic changes. Cell populations with heterogeneous genetic makeup, such as those of infectious microbial organisms or cancer, rely on their inherent robustness to maintain viability and fitness, but when encountering environmental insults, such as drug treatment, these populations are also poised for rapid adaptation through evolutionary selection. In this study, we develop a general mathematical model that allows us to explain and quantify this fundamental relationship between robustness and evolvability of heterogeneous cell populations. Our model predicts that robustness is, in fact, essential for evolvability, especially for more adverse environments, a trend we observe in aneuploid budding yeast and breast cancer cells. Robustness also compensates for the negative impact of the systems' complexity on their evolvability. Our model also provides a mathematical means to estimate the number of independent processes underlying a system's performance and identify the most generally adapted subpopulation, which may resemble the multi-drug-resistant ""persister"" cells observed in cancer."
445605000004,PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED,"Chaos and the Flow Capture Problem: Polluting is Easy, Cleaning is Hard","Cleaning pollution from a heterogeneous flow environment is far from simple. We consider the flow capture problem, which has flows and sinks in a heterogeneous environment, and investigate the problem of positioning pollutant capture units. We show that arrays of capture units carry a high risk of failure without accounting for environmental heterogeneity and chaos in their placement, design, and operation. Our idealized two-dimensional models reveal salient features of the problem. Maximum capture efficiency depends on the required capture rate: long-term efficiency decreases as the number of capture units increases, whereas short-term efficiency increases. If efficiency is important, the capture process should begin as early as feasible. Knowledge of transport controlling flow structures offers predictability for unit placement. We demonstrate two heuristic approaches to near-optimally position capture units."

Nine samples were obtained from producing well. The analyzed samples contain TOC ranging between 0.98 and 2.45wt.%. S2 values of Rock-Eval show poor potential with values ranging from 0.02 to 0.27mg HC/g rock. The samples have low hydrogen index values ranging from 3 to 27mg HC/g TOC and also having low T-max values ranging from 427 to 431 degrees C. On the basis of analysis performed, only three studied samples have early maturity, two from Ranikot and one from Samana Suk formation, whereas rest of the samples are in immature zones as indicated by HI vs T-max plot; no samples from Shinwari Formation lie in maturity window. All of the samples have kerogen Type III and have poor generation potential. Hence, from the result, some minor gas could be expected to have been generated in the study area."
442598400021,IET ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS,Sliding-mode observer-based speed-sensorless vector control of linear induction motor with a parallel secondary resistance online identification,"This study proposes a speed estimation scheme for the sensorless-vector-controlled linear induction motor (LIM) drives for medium-low-speed maglev applications, which is composed of two parts: (i) a sliding mode model reference adaptive system observer for speed estimation; and (ii) a parallel secondary resistance online identification for achieving the improvements of the proposed speed estimation scheme performance. The sliding mode observer (SMO) is established on the basis of the state space-vector model of the LIM considering the dynamic end effect. Based on SMO, both speed and secondary resistance estimation algorithms are obtained by utilising Popov's hyperstability theory. Moreover, the Lyapunov stability theory is adopted for the stability analysis of the proposed speed estimation scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed speed estimation algorithm has been verified and compared with the performance of the conventional speed estimation scheme based on single-manifold SMO by the simulation and hardware-in-the-loop tests."
429114900008,BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,"Seismicity Pattern, Reference Velocity Model, and Earthquake Mechanics of South India","We present a comprehensive study of seismicity and associated phenomena in south India based on analysis of local earthquakes recorded at 54 broadband seismic stations operated in three phases during February 2009 and April 2012. South India is a primarily stable continent and consists of Precambrian terrains such as the eastern Dharwar craton (EDC), the western Dharwar craton (WDC), the southern Granulite terrain (SGT), and the Cuddapah basin intruded with large dikes, shear zones, and rifted margins. A 1D reference velocity model is derived using 405 local earthquakes, each with a minimum seven P- and six S-phase readings and an azimuth gap < 180 degrees. Finally, all the recorded 780 local earthquakes (1.2 <= M-L <= 4.6) are relocated using this reference velocity model. The seismicity is more in the EDC and northeastern part of the SGT, compared to the WDC. The earthquakes are generally confined to the upper 20 km depth. However, we also observe a few lower-crustal earthquakes in the EDC that may be associated with the composition of rocks and geothermal gradient along with deep-seated faults. We calculate fault-plane solutions of 18 well-distributed small earthquakes using moment tensor inversion and 3 earthquakes from the first motion of P polarity. The obtained focal mechanism solutions show dominance of a strike-slip mode of deformation in south India, except for the Koyna-Warna region, where normal-type solutions also exist. The P-axis trend is north-south and northeast direction in the maximum part of south India, correlating with the northward movement of the Indian plate. In the easternmost part of the SGT region, we observe a rotation of the P-axis trend in a northwest direction, which may be due to a local perturbation of the regional stress field. The stress-tensor inversion of the fault-plane solutions indicates that the maximum compressive stress is north-south directed."
455338100099,SUSTAINABILITY,Spatiotemporal Analysis of Land Use/Land Cover and Its Effects on Surface Urban Heat Island Using Landsat Data: A Case Study of Metropolitan City Tehran (1988-2018),"This article summarized the spatiotemporal pattern of land use/land cover (LU/LC) and urban heat island (UHI) dynamics in the Metropolitan city of Tehran between 1988 and 2018. The study showed dynamics of each LU/LC class and their role in influencing the UHI. The impervious surface area expanded by 286.04 (48.27% of total land) and vegetated land was depleted by 42.06 km(2) (7.10% of total land) during the period of 1988-2018. The mean land surface temperature (LST) has enlarged by approximately 2-3 degrees C at the city center and 5-7 degrees C at the periphery between 1988 and 2018 based on the urban-rural gradient analysis. The lower mean LST was experienced by vegetation land (VL) and water body (WB) by approximately 4-5 degrees C and 5-7 degrees C, respectively, and the higher mean LST by open land (OL) by 7-11 degrees C than other LU/LC classes at all time-points during the time period, 1988-2018. The magnitude of mean LST was calculated based on the main LU/LC categories, where impervious land (IL) recorded the higher temperature difference compared to vegetation land (VL) and water bodies (WB). However, open land (OL) recorded the highest mean LST differences with all the other LU/LC categories. In addition to that, there was an overall negative correlation between LST and the normal difference vegetation index (NDVI). By contrast, there was an overall positive correlation between LST and the normal difference built-up index (NDBI). This article, executed through three decadal change analyses from 1988 to 2018 at 10-year intervals, has made a significant contribution to delineating the long records of change dynamics and could have a great influence on policy making to foster environmental sustainability."
447753300006,CELL BIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL,Sphingosine-1-phosphate promotes the proliferation and attenuates apoptosis of Endothelial progenitor cells via S1PR1/S1PR3/PI3K/Akt pathway,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lysophospholipid that involves in numerous pathophysiological processes. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a crucial role in endothelial repair and tumor angiogenesis. The aim of study was to determine the effects of S1P on proliferation and anti-apoptosis of EPCs and their signaling pathways. In this study, we showed that S1P, SEW2871 (a selective S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) agonist), or CYM5541 (a selective S1P receptor 3 (S1PR3) allosteric agonist promotes the proliferation and attenuates apoptosis of bone marrow (BM)-derived EPCs. Futhermore, it was showed that S1P could promote EPCs proliferation, which could be significantly inhibited by pretreatment with CAY10444 (an S1PR3 antagonist), VPC23019 (a selective S1PR(1)/S1PR(3) antagonist), or LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor). Moveover, we discovered that S1P could significantly attenuate H2O2-induced apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 in vitro, while W146 (an S1PR1 antagonist), VPC23019, or LY294002 could significantly increase the activation of caspase-3 and subsequent augmented apoptosis. Our results indicated that the protective effect of S1P is mediated by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, S1P promotion of EPCs proliferation was observed to be mainly mediated through S1PR3 and attenuation of EPCs apoptosis induced by H2O2 was mainly mediated through S1PR1; both of these effects are mediated by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, which provides potentially useful therapeutic targets for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer treatment."
423140500036,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,Effect of Interfacial Energetics on Charge Transfer from Lead Halide Perovskite to Organic Hole Conductors,"The control and optimization of interfacial charge transfer processes is crucial to the design of efficient perovskite solar cells. Herein, we measure the yield and kinetics of hole transfer across the methylammonium lead triiodide perovskitelpolymeric hole transport material heterojunction, as a function of the interfacial energy offset, Delta E, between the highest occupied molecular orbital of the hole transport material and the valence band edge of the perovskite. A combination of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, along with transient absorption spectroscopy, revealed that only a small driving energy (Delta E similar to 0.07 eV) is required to induce highly efficient hole transfer. The findings of this paper suggest that further improvements in the open-circuit voltage, and so the power conversion efficiency, of perovskite solar cells could be achieved by incorporating hole transport materials that provide an interfacial energy offset in the range 0 < Delta E < 0.18 eV."
435220000004,ONCOLOGY RESEARCH,Downregulated Trophinin-Associated Protein Plays a Critical Role in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Through Upregulation of Tumor Cell Growth and Migration,"Trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) was a protein first identified to mediate the process of embryo transplantation and later found to be involved in microtubule regulation. However, little is known about the role of TROAP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we reported that both TROAP mRNA and protein expressions were downregulated in human HCC samples as well as cell lines. A high level of TROAP was associated with small tumor size (p < 0.05), minor tumor nodules (p < 0.01), and mild vein invasion (p < 0.05). We further constructed in vitro TROAP depletion and overexpression HCC cell models. TROAP depletion significantly enhanced the proliferation and colony formation abilities, whereas TROAP overexpression had an inhibitory effect on the growth of HCC cells. The G(1)/S phase arrest by TROAP overexpression correlated with increased cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27, and declined cell cycle promoting kinase complex CDK6/cyclin D1. Depressed TROAP expression enhanced the migration ability, while the opposite influence was observed in TROAP-overexpressed HCC cells. Taken together, these results indicate that TROAP suppresses cellular growth and migration in HCC. This discovery will further our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of human HCC."
431281900085,PLOS ONE,A multi-antigenic MVA vaccine increases efficacy of combination chemotherapy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Despite the existence of the prophylactic Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a major public health issue causing up to 1.8 million annual deaths worldwide. Increasing prevalence of Mtb strains resistant to antibiotics represents an urgent threat for global health that has prompted a search for alternative treatment regimens not subject to development of resistance. Immunotherapy constitutes a promising approach to improving current antibiotic treatments through engagement of the host's immune system. We designed a multi-antigenic and multiphasic vaccine, based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, denoted MVATG18598, which expresses ten antigens classically described as representative of each of different phases of Mtb infection. In vitro analysis coupled with multiple-passage evaluation demonstrated that this vaccine is genetically stable, i.e. fit for manufacturing. Using different mouse strains, we show that MVATG18598 vaccination results in both Th1-associated T-cell responses and cytolytic activity, targeting all 10 vaccine-expressed Mtb antigens. In chronic post-exposure mouse models, MVATG18598 vaccination in combination with an antibiotic regimen decreases the bacterial burden in the lungs of infected mice, compared with chemotherapy alone, and is associated with long-lasting antigen-specific Th1-type T cell and antibody responses. In one model, co-treatment with MVATG18598 prevented relapse of the disease after treatment completion, an important clinical goal. Overall, results demonstrate the capacity of the therapeutic MVATG18598 vaccine to improve efficacy of chemotherapy against TB. These data support further development of this novel immunotherapeutic in the treatment of Mtb infections."

The procedures of both the improved and typical grey prediction models are graphically portrayed to display the differences. A matrix based algorithm is proposed to represent the relationship between the initial condition and development coefficient as well as the matrix representations for estimating the two parameters according to the least square method. A property involving the connections of the parameters and errors between two sequences having multiple relationships is derived based on the nonlinear algebraic relation of the two parameters. Finally, a real case as well as a numerical example is utilized to show the effective results of the proposed model."

The goal of our study was to reliably quantify PBR and assess its potential use as a new marker of cardiovascular pathology. Methods: The study included 208 patients (123 men and 85 women from 40 to 65 years of age) with various grades of cardiovascular SCORE risk index and IHD. PBR was quantified by sidestream dark field capillaroscopy with green light excitation. Cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated with laser Doppler fluorometry. Results: Elevated PBR values over 2 mm were associated with morphological and functional lesions of arterial wall and microcirculation and lowered levels of ApoA1 lipoprotein. Moreover, elevated PBR values were associated with 2.07-fold increase in prevalence of cerebral atherosclerosis (P = .015) and 2.42-fold increase in prevalence of IHD (P = .024). Increase in PBR was associated with elevated systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Thus, PBR can be considered a new highly reproducible and promising marker candidate for non-invasive diagnostics of IHD and cerebral atherosclerosis suggesting important role of microcirculation in development and progression of cardiovascular diseases."

These groups cohere around their own unique discourses of law, language, and history, which are often dismissed as meaningless, or even crazy. Following Jacques Lacan's injunction that the analyst must let the subject speak, this essay will examine sovereign citizen rhetoric as a coherent, internally consistent field of meaning exhibiting the traits of psychotic discourse in which the metaphorical operation of the law-as-signifier is disavowed. Doing so illustrates not only the powerful intersection of communication and psychoanalysis but also the potential for a rhetorical reading to challenge the most violent collective psychoses."
427585700012,MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES,MHD Stokes flow and heat transfer in a lid-driven square cavity under horizontal magnetic field,"This study considers the steady flow of a viscous, incompressible and electrically conducting fluid in a lid-driven square cavity under the effect of a uniform horizontally applied magnetic field. The governing equations are obtained from the Navier-Stokes equations including buoyancy and Lorentz force terms and the energy equation including Joule heating and viscous dissipation terms. These equations are solved iteratively in terms of velocity components, stream function, vorticity, temperature, and pressure by using radial basis function approximation. Particular solution, which is approximated by radial basis functions to satisfy both differential equation and boundary conditions, becomes the solution of the differential equation itself. Vorticity boundary conditions are obtained from stream function equation using finite difference scheme. Normal derivative of pressure is taken as zero on the boundary. The numerical results are obtained for several values of Hartmann number and Grashof number for the Stokes approximation (Re<<1). The results show that when the viscous dissipation is present, the flow and isolines concentrate through the cold wall forming boundary layers as Grashof number increases. An increase in the magnetic field intensity retards the effect of buoyancy force in the square cavity, whereas the movement of the upper lid causes buoyancy force to be dominant. The solution is obtained in a considerably low computational expense through the use of radial basis function approximations for the MHD equations. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
443836100001,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,How has the cost of antiretroviral therapy changed over the years? A database analysis in Italy,"Background: The number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related hospitalizations has decreased worldwide in recent years, due to the availability of combined antiretroviral therapies (cART). The present analysis aimed to analyse the economic, and clinical burden of HIV management, after the introduction of systematic use of cART. Methods: Data from HIV-infected patients, treated at Policlinico San Martino Hospital in Genova (Italy) were retrospectively collected. A comparison between years 2009 and 2015 was performed. HIV-related admissions were identified by using the Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes. The resource consumption of outpatient services was derived by using a modelling approach. Expenditure for drugs was also analysed, as aggregate data. Results: The number of HIV-infected patients was 898 in 2009 and 1006 in 2015. Overall, the virological success rate improved from 2009 to 2015, as the percentage of patients with HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL increased from 79 to 89% (P < 0.05). The average incidence of hospitalizations per-patient decreased from 0.30 in 2009, to 0.13 in 2015. Average expenditure per-patient decreased from (sic)10,107 in 2009 to (sic)9063 in 2015. Conclusions: The present analysis confirmed the role of cART in controlling HIV viral load and, consequently, in reducing hospitalizations, admissions to day-hospital and the use of outpatient services. Clinical improvements and economic savings more than compensated the investments required to treat HIV-infected patients with cART. Health Authorities should invest in modern cART supply and universal treatment, to use at best the available resources and obtain a cost-effective improvement of health in people living with HIV. Additional research, with the involvement of different centers and the use of patient-specific data, are recommended to consolidate the findings of this analysis."

An incubation study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of biochar (BC), zeolite (ZE) and rock phosphate (RP) stabilizers on the immobilization of cadmium (Cd) in contaminated soils. Various extraction techniques were carried out: a sequential extraction procedure, the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR), the toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP) and extraction with ammonium nitrate. In addition, Cd adsorption by these materials was observed using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The results showed that with an increase in soil pH the exchangeable fraction of Cd in soil was significantly reduced by 28%-29.4%, 9%-13% and 4%-14% for BC, ZE, and RP, respectively. According to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, BC-amended soil showed a higher adsorption capacity (Q(m)) of Cd from 8.38 to 19.85 mg g(-1). Overall, BC offered better results when compared to other amendments."

Our calculation results show that NbAs and TaAs have similar phase diagrams, the same structural phase transition sequence I4(1)md -> P (6) over bar m2 -> P2(1)/c -> Pm (3) over barm, and slightly different transition pressures. The phase transition sequence of NbP and TaP differs somewhat from that of NbAs and TaAs, in which new structures emerge, such as the Cmcm structure in NbP and the Pmmn structure in TaP. Interestingly, we found that in the electronic structure of the high-pressure phase P (6) over bar m2-NbAs, there are coexisting Weyl points and triple degenerate points, similar to those found in high-pressure P (6) over bar m2-TaAs."

This study uses nationally published CMV seroprevalence and breastfeeding rates to estimate the contribution of CMV DNA in breast milk to false-positive saliva PCR results. The false-positive rates adjusted for breastfeeding ranged from 0.03% in white Hispanic persons to 0.14% in white non-Hispanic persons. Saliva CMV PCR for newborn screening is highly sensitive, and the low false-positive rates in this study suggest that saliva PCR results are unlikely to be significantly influenced by breastfeeding or other perinatal exposures."

453488000022,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA,Thermodynamic Parameters of a New Synthesized Tricationic Ionic Liquid Stationary Phase by Inverse Gas Chromatography,"A new tricationic ionic liquid [benz(2NPTim)(3)](NTf2)(3) with three N-naphthyl imidazolium cations has been synthesized and used as a stationary phase in gas chromatography. The stationary phase was characterized using the inverse gas chromatography technique. The McReynolds constants, Abraham solvation parameters, the activity coeficients (y(infinity)), selectivities (S-ij(infinity)), and capacities (k(j)(infinity)) at infinite dilution were determined accordingly. The TGA analysis showed that the stationary phase had high thermal stability up to 673 K. On the basis of the obtained data from the McReynolds constants, the stationary phase had an average polarity of 1153 and polarity number equal to 130, which indicates its highly polar nature. The Abraham solvation parameters were compared to that of other stationary phases and revealed stronger H-bond basicity, dipole dipole, and dispersive interactions with the solutes. The Kovats retention indexes obtained for polyaromatic compounds suggest that the stationary phase has strong interactions with these compounds."

Marine plants such as Ecklonia cava Kjellman contain high amounts of polyphenolic antioxidants. The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidative effects of E. cava extract in cultured keratinocytes exposed to airborne particulate matter with a diameter of <10 mu m (PM10). After the exposure of cultured HaCaT keratinocytes to PM10 in the absence and presence of E. cava extract and its constituents, cell viability and cellular lipid peroxidation were assessed. The effects of eckol and dieckol on cellular lipid peroxidation and cytokine expression were examined in human epidermal keratinocytes exposed to PM10. The total phenolic content of E. cava extract was the highest among the 50 marine plant extracts examined. The exposure of HaCaT cells to PM10 decreased cell viability and increased lipid peroxidation. The PM10-induced cellular lipid peroxidation was attenuated by E. cava extract and its ethyl acetate fraction. Dieckol more effectively attenuated cellular lipid peroxidation than eckol in both HaCaT cells and human epidermal keratinocytes. Dieckol and eckol attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) alpha, interleukin-(IL-) 1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 in human epidermal keratinocytes stimulated with PM10. This study suggested that the polyphenolic constituents of E. cava, such as dieckol, attenuated the oxidative and inflammatory reactions in skin cells exposed to airborne particulate matter."
422969600009,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY,A Two-Dimensional Metal-Organic Framework as a Fluorescent Probe for Ascorbic Acid Sensing,"Ascorbic acid (AA) is an important biological molecule, but the detection of AA is still a huge challenge. Therefore, highly sensitive and selective fluorescent sensors for AA determination are urgently demanded. In this work, the new organic linker 4,4-(1H-pyrazole-1,3-diyl)dibenzoic acid (H2L) was prepared to construct the new two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) ZnL(H2O) (ZJU-137, ZJU = Zhejiang University). The ZJU-137 MOF demonstrates high selectivity and sensitivity for the detection of AA through fluorescence quenching. The detection limit for AA was 34 nM, and a wide linear concentration-dependent response (0-60 mu m) was observed; hence, ZJU-137 has promising potential for the determination of AA in practical applications."
430773800010,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,Power as agency: A critical reflection on the measurement of women's empowerment in the development sector,"Despite extensive literature on the complex nature of empowerment, current efforts to measure women's empowerment in the agricultural development sector are largely limited to assessing visible forms of agency. We take a critical look at current efforts to measure women's empowerment at the individual/ household level through standardized tools. We examine the results of a household survey conducted in Nepal using the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), which was developed as a monitoring and evaluation tool for the Feed the Future Initiative. Our interpretation of the results is informed by qualitative fieldwork conducted in the same region. In our quantitative analysis, we regress correlates of empowerment identified in the literature, such as age, education, household wealth, income, and household composition, on individual empowerment as measured by the WEAI. While several factors associated with women's empowerment are significantly associated, household composition and intra-household relationships, which we expected to be essential factors in the local context, appear to be unrelated to the WEAI empowerment score. A measure of critical consciousness tested alongside the WEAI instrument appears instead to be closely associated with these factors. Our qualitative findings reveal that there is a discrepancy between local meanings of empowerment and definitions of empowerment defined in terms of agency. Based on these results, we suggest that improvements in measurement may be possible if approaches that measure power predominantly in terms of agency or decision-making were to include critical consciousness in their framework.

432620900007,JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE,Workplace Incivility as Modern Sexual Prejudice,"Although discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is prohibited by law in many countries, negative prejudices against Lesbian and Gay (LG) people, as a stigmatized minority, might be internalized by co-workers, being a source of a modern and subtle form of discrimination. Results from 39 in-depth semi-structured interviews with LG employees show that they are victims of workplace incivility which is manifested through jokes, use of language, stereotypes, and intrusive behaviors. Such acts are barely recognizable as a form of discrimination, due to the absence of any reference to sexual orientation, and for this reason it is more difficult to act against them at an organizational level. This is the first study that demonstrates how workplace incivility toward LG employees can be an expression of a subtle form of discrimination. It shows that discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation has not disappeared; it has simply changed its manifestations. Contributions and implications of the study are discussed from a theoretical and a practical perspective."
441465700005,INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH,Development of pH Independent Drug Release System for Dipyridamole,"Introduction: Dipyridamole is an Anti-platelet agent exhibits release problems at higher pH of small intestine due to its pH dependent solubility and precipitation followed by interruption of drug release from dosage form. To overcome this extended release formulation was developed by using pH modulating agent (tartaric acid). Objective: Present study was undertaken with a view of the formulations evaluated by performing dissolution testing on developed extended released tablets. Method: development of dissolution method at different time points and USP Apparatus 1 (basket) and 2 (paddle) at rotating speeds of 50 or 100 rpm used to evaluate the release characteristics of the formulations. Furthermore, solubility and in vitro dissolution studies of formulated tablets were performed at pH values of 1.2 and 5.5. Results: In this study we found increasing volume of dissolution medium pH 5.5 phosphate buffers drug precipitation is increased. The developed dissolution method was validated according to ICH guidelines for various parameters such as specificity, accuracy, precision, and stability. The dissolution method was confirmed by determining the dissolution rate of extended released Dipyridamole tablets containing pH modulating agent. The best in vitro dissolution profile was obtained using pH 5.5 phosphate buffer as the dissolution medium (500 ml) stirred at 100 rpm. A comparison of the dissolution profiles in official and developed media showed significant differences based on f1 and f2 values. Conclusion: The developed dissolution test exhibited a higher capacity than the compendia methods in differentiating the release profiles of pH independent extended release tablets. It can be applied during formulation development and quality control analysis of pH independent extended release tablets for evaluation of the effects of pH modifier in dissolution medium and processing parameters."

The results indicate that English proficiency positively impacts academic performance, but at a declining rate. This non-linear relationship is sensitive to whether students placed into an English as a Second Language program are included in the sample or not and the type of achievement variable considered, thus highlighting a more nuanced result than expected."
453250000039,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,The 2017 Record Marine Heatwave in the Southwestern Atlantic Shelf,"Marine heatwaves (MHWs), considered as one when temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period are registered for five or more consecutive days, can have devastating ecosystem and socioeconomic consequences. MHWs were studied in the Southwestern Atlantic shelf (32-38 degrees S) using daily sea surface temperatures between 1988 and 2017. More than half of the days with MHWs occurred since 2014. The most intense event happened in austral summer 2017, reaching temperatures of 26.8 degrees C, 1.7 degrees C above previous maximum. Regionally, an unprecedented combination of persistent extremely high air temperature and low wind speed probably led to an intense loop of heat gaining and stratification in the Rio de la Plata plume water's influence. At upper levels, the atmospheric circulation had a wavenumber of 3 pattern before the event and a blocking configuration during the event. Madden-Julian Oscillation seems to have played a leading role in setting this planetary scale configuration. Plain Language Summary The area between Rio Grande (Brazil) and Mar del Plata (Argentina) up to 200km off the coast experienced the most intense warming of the last 30years of sea surface temperature satellite record between 16 February and 9 March 2017. This anomalous warming, categorized as a marine heatwave, reached 26.8 degrees C, 1.7 degrees C above previous maximum and caused in the capital city of Uruguay fish mass mortalities and a toxic algae bloom, leading to the closure of recreational beaches for some days. Regionally, an unprecedented combination of persistent extremely high air temperature and low wind speed probably led to an intense loop of heat gaining and vertical stratification of the water column. The tropical Madden-Julian Oscillation seems to have played a leading role in setting this atmospheric configuration. Our results stress the importance of deepening the study of marine heatwaves in this region, as they are becoming more frequent since 2014."
441089800006,PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,Characterization of interfacial barrier charging as a resistive switching mechanism in Ag/Sb2Te3/Ag heterojunctions,"In this study, bipolar memristive behaviors were systematically characterized in Ag/Sb2Te3/Ag hetero-junctions. By using in situ Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, a direct observation of the bonding environment and band structure confirmed that resistive switches are strongly related to the electronic valence changes in Sb2Te3 and the formation of Schottky barriers at Ag/Sb2Te3 interfaces. Band movement of Sb2Te3 acquired by first-principles calculations also supports the electrostatic barrier charging as a memristive mechanism of Ag/Sb2Te3/Ag heterocells. Independent resistance-switching behaviors that can be utilized in both amorphous and crystalline Sb2Te3 lead to multiple resistance values with a large memory window (10(4)-10(5)) and low read voltage (similar to 0.2 V), giving rise to a unique multi-level memory concept. This study based on Ag/Sb2Te3/Ag hetero-junctions offers a significant understanding to promote the use of Sb2Te3 and other chalcogenide memristors as promising candidates for compatible high-density memory applications."
428437100027,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,Heterogeneous Ice Nucleation Ability of NaCl and Sea Salt Aerosol Particles at Cirrus Temperatures,"In situ measurements of the composition of heterogeneous cirrus ice cloud residuals have indicated a substantial contribution of sea salt in sampling regions above the ocean. We have investigated the heterogeneous ice nucleation ability of sodium chloride (NaCl) and sea salt aerosol (SSA) particles at cirrus cloud temperatures between 235 and 200K in the Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere aerosol and cloud chamber. Effloresced NaCl particles were found to act as ice nucleating particles in the deposition nucleation mode at temperatures below about 225K, with freezing onsets in terms of the ice saturation ratio, S-ice, between 1.28 and 1.40. Above 225K, the crystalline NaCl particles deliquesced and nucleated ice homogeneously. The heterogeneous ice nucleation efficiency was rather similar for the two crystalline forms of NaCl (anhydrous NaCl and NaCl dihydrate). Mixed-phase (solid/liquid) SSA particles were found to act as ice nucleating particles in the immersion freezing mode at temperatures below about 220K, with freezing onsets in terms of S-ice between 1.24 and 1.42. Above 220K, the SSA particles fully deliquesced and nucleated ice homogeneously. Ice nucleation active surface site densities of the SSA particles were found to be in the range between 1.0 10(10) and 1.0 10(11)m(-2) at T<220K. These values are of the same order of magnitude as ice nucleation active surface site densities recently determined for desert dust, suggesting a potential contribution of SSA particles to low-temperature heterogeneous ice nucleation in the atmosphere."
442227200012,JOURNAL OF INVASIVE CARDIOLOGY,Orbital Atherectomy of Severely Calcified Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery Disease: One-Year Outcomes,"Objective. We assessed the 1-year outcomes of patients who underwent orbital atherectomy for severely calcified unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease. Background. The standard of care for ULMCA is coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a reasonable option for the treatment for ULMCA disease, especially in patients who are not good candidates for surgical revascularization. Coronary artery calcification is associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients who undergo PCI. Modification of severely calcified plaque with orbital atherectomy facilitates stent delivery and expansion. Data on intermediate outcomes of patients with ULMCA disease who undergo orbital atherectomy are unknown. Methods. We retrospectively evaluated 62 patients who underwent PCI with orbital atherectomy for ULMCA disease. The primary endpoint was the major cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) rate, which was the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target-lesion revascularization, and stroke at 1 year. Results. Distal bifurcation disease was present in 71.0%, and a single-stent strategy was used in 90.5%. No patients experienced coronary perforation or no-reflow. Two patients experienced coronary dissection (3.2%). One patient experienced BARC-2 bleeding (1.6%). At 1 year, the MACCE rate was 11.3%, with cardiac death occurring in 1.6%, myocardial infarction in 8.1%, and target-lesion revascularization in 4.8%. Non-cardiac death occurred in 4.8%. No patient experienced stroke or stent thrombosis. Conclusion. Orbital atherectomy is an acceptable treatment option for patients with severely calcified ULMCA disease, especially if patients are deemed too high risk for surgical revascularization."
422934800001,ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS,"High-Performance, Self-Driven Photodetector Based on Graphene Sandwiched GaSe/WS2 Heterojunction","Restacking the exfoliated 2D layered materials into complex heterostructures with new functionality has opened a new platform for materials engineering and device application. In this work, graphene sandwiched p-GaSe/n-WS2 vertical heterostructures are fabricated for photodetection. The devices show excellent performance on photodetection from ultraviolet to visible wavelength range, including high photoresponsivity (approximate to 149 A W-1 at 410 nm), short response time of 37 mu s, and self-powered photodetection. The scanning photocurrent microscopy is also employed to investigate the photocurrent generation in the heterojunction and a significant enhancement of the photoresponse is found in the overlapping region. The results suggest that the graphene sandwiched vertical heterojunctions are promising in future novel optoelectronic devices applications."
427142300008,RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY,Spermine Pre-Treatment Improves Some Physiochemical Parameters and Sodium Transporter Gene Expression of Pumpkin Seedlings under Salt Stress,"It is known that polyamines (PAs) including spermine (Spm) enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of crops. Here, the effects of hydroponic Spm pre-treatment on the amelioration of the adverse effects of salinity were investigated in pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) that is an economically important horticultural crop and sensitive to salinity, especially at the establishment stage. For this purpose, 10-day-old, uniform-sized seedlings were transplanted to plastic containers containing Hoagland nutrient solution. Spm was added at 0.1 and 1 mM to the hydroponic medium for 5 days before stress. The plants were treated with 40 and 80 mM NaCl for inducing salinity stress. Salt stress reduced the plant growth and potassium content in roots, and these detrimental effects were alleviated when plants were pre-treated with Spm. Salinity stress caused a significant increase in sodium and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) content when compared with controls. Spm pre-treatment ameliorated these salinity stress effects by increasing sodium content of root and leaves GABA content. Expression analysis of two sodium transporter genes, salt overly sensitive1 (SOS1) and Na+/H+ exchanger (NHX1) revealed that their expression was differentially induced in roots of plants treated either with salinity or Spm. These results suggest that Spm via the overexpression of the NHX1 gene substantially increased the tolerance to stress by sequestering excess Na+ into the vacuoles and sustaining a better cellular environment. Moreover, Spm has potential to scavenge directly free radical and to alleviate growth inhibition and promote the activity of antioxidant system enzymes in pumpkin seedlings under salt stress."
446481300019,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS,Enhanced stability and efficiency of Sn containing perovskite solar cell with SnCl2 and SnI2 precursors,"Presence of toxic Pb and device stability are the main issues with perovskite solar cell. For Pb replacement, most likely substitute is Sn, which is a metal of group 14 (like Pb). Thus, in the present study, the amount of Pb is reduced and replaced by Sn. To achieve the replacement, use of SnCl2 is explored in addition to generally used precursor (SnI2), as the source of Sn. Molar ratio of PbI2:SnCl2/SnI2 is varied to get optimum performance of perovskite solar cell. Pt-FTO counter electrode is used in addition to spiro-MeTAD (as hole transport material). The power conversion efficiency of solar cells containing 2:2 molar ratio of PbI2:SnCl2 was enhanced to 10.10%, and PbI2:/SnI2 was enhanced to 10.61%. Without Sn addition (CH3NH3PbI3) the efficiency was only 7.39%. The clear enhancement of 37% (SnCl2) and 43% (SnI2) is highly encouraging, as it leads to less toxic and highly efficient solar cells at the same time. In addition, the percentage loss in power conversion efficiency of device prepared with SnCl2 (CH3NH3Pb0.5Sn0.5ICl2) was also superior (10days)."
431973400005,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Exploring the energy landscape of resistive switching in antiferromagnetic Sr3Ir2O7,We study the resistive switching triggered by an applied electrical bias in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator Sr3Ir2O7. The switching was previously associated with an electric-field-driven structural transition. Here we use time-resolved measurements to probe the thermal activation behavior of the switching process and acquire information about the energy barrier associated with the transition. We quantify the changes in the energy-barrier height with respect to the applied bias and find a linear decrease of the barrier with increasing bias. Our observations support the potential of antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides for spintronic applications.
431627300065,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Systematic realization of double-zero-index phononic crystals with hard inclusions,"A systematic process is described to realize double-zero-index phononic crystals with Dirac-like points experimentally. This type of crystal normally has softer inclusion material than its surroundings medium, allowing mapping into a zero-index medium under certain conditions but also making experimental implementation difficult. On the other hand, realizing phononic crystals with hard inclusions can be experimentally more feasible, but the mapping conditions cannot be directly applied to hard-inclusion crystals such that mapping is not systematically guaranteed in these cases. Moreover, even if such crystals become realizable, there is a lack of a systematic design process which can be used to optimize or to redesign the crystals, which largely limits their potential applications. In this paper, we discover the essential conditions for realizing phononic crystals with hard inclusions and propose a methodology for the systematic design of these crystals using homogenization based on the effective medium theory. Using the proposed method, a double-zero-index phononic crystal with hard inclusions is optimized and experimentally realized for an underwater ultrasonic wave collimator."

438080400001,PULMONARY CIRCULATION,Interleukin-6 trans-signaling contributes to chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleotropic cytokine that signals through the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) to induce antiinflammatory (""classic-signaling"") responses. This cytokine also binds to the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) to promote inflammation (""trans-signaling""). mIL-6R expression is restricted to hepatocytes and immune cells. Activated T cells release sIL-6R into adjacent tissues to induce trans-signaling. These cellular actions require the ubiquitously expressed membrane receptor gp 130. Reports show that IL-6 is produced by pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) exposed to hypoxia in culture as well as the medial layer of the pulmonary arteries in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia (CH), and IL-6 knockout mice are protected from CH-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH). IL-6 has the potential to contribute to a broad array of downstream effects, such as cell growth and migration. CH-induced PH is associated with increased proliferation and migration of PASMCs to previously non-muscularized vessels of the lung. We tested the hypothesis that IL-6 trans-signaling contributes to CH-induced PH and arterial remodeling. Plasma levels of sgp 130 were significantly decreased in mice exposed to CH (380 mmHg) for five days compared to normoxic control mice (630 mmHg), while sIL-6R levels were unchanged. Consistent with our hypothesis, mice that received the IL-6 trans-signaling-specific inhibitor sgp 130Fc, a fusion protein of the soluble extracellular portion of gp 130 with the constant portion of the mouse IgG I antibody, showed attenuation of CH-induced increases in right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular and pulmonary arterial remodeling as compared to vehicle (saline)-treated control mice. In addition, PASMCs cultured in the presence of IL-6 and sIL-6R showed enhanced migration but not proliferation compared to those treated with IL-6 or sIL-6R alone or in the presence of sgp 130Fc. These results indicate that IL-6 trans-signaling contributes to pulmonary arterial cell migration and CH-induced PH."
445912700012,NEUROSCIENCE,The Age-dependent Elevation of miR-335-3p Leads to Reduced Cholesterol and Impaired Memory in Brain,"MiR-335-3p, a neuron-enriched microRNA, has been reported to be involved in aging and age-related neurological diseases. However, the role of miR-335-3p in cholesterol metabolism of astrocytes, and whether it affects neuronal functions, particularly during aging process, largely remains unknown. In this study, we uncover that miR-335-3p is significantly increased in aged cultured astrocytes and aged hippocampal brains, accompanied by decreased cellular cholesterol and diminished expression of HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase-1 (HMGCS1), both step-limiting enzymes in cholesterol synthesis pathway. We also demonstrate that miR-335-3p suppresses HMGCS1 post-transcriptionally by directly binding to its 3'UTR, and HMGCR through binding mediated by SFRS2. More importantly, aged mice with miR-335-3p deficiency in hippocampal brains exhibit improved learning and memory, accompanied by enhanced levels of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). We further reveal that the level change of PSD95 is resulted from altered cholesterol metabolism. Our findings provide a novel insight into the regulatory role of miR-335-3p in cholesterol metabolism in astrocytes, and consequently cognitive functions during aging. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

428347000011,JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS AND HEAT TRANSFER,Spreading Resistance in Multilayered Orthotropic Flux Channel with Temperature-Dependent Thermal Conductivities,"Anisotropic materials have received remarkable attention in the development of microelectronic devices. In many materials, the thermal conductivities are temperature-dependent and usually are approximated by constant thermal conductivities when considering thermal analysis. In this paper, analytical solutions of the temperature rise and the thermal resistance of a multilayered three-dimensional flux channel with orthotropic temperature-dependent thermal conductivities are addressed by means of the Kirchhoff transform, which is considered as a powerful method for dealing with nonlinear conduction problems with temperature-dependent thermal conductivities. A single eccentric heat source is considered in the source plane of the flux channel, where heat enters the system and flows by conduction through the layers to reach a convective heat sink with uniform heat transfer coefficient. The solutions are extended to account for multiple eccentric heat sources in the source plane. Further, the analytical solutions have been validated by solving the problem numerically with the finite element method using the ANSYS commercial software package."

To analyze its genetic structure and diversity, microsatellite markers were developed using 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 27,352 reads containing di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide microsatellite repeat units were identified from 136,537 reads. Among 80 loci containing more than six repeat motifs, 32 primer sets (40%) produced reproducible PCR products, and all of these loci were polymorphic. Some loci showed deviations from HWE and possible null allele's presence, results of an excess of homozygotes. In an analysis of 45 individuals from one E. ringens population, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 33, observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.171 to 0.976, and the probability of identity values ranged from 0.006 to 0.513. These microsatellites will be useful for numerous ecological studies focused on this important pelagic fish; including the examination of population genetic structure, estimating effective population size and providing information for fisheries management."
428611700002,HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE,"Proximity to chronic wasting disease, perceived risk, and social trust in the managing agency","This article examined relationships between proximity to chronic wasting disease (CWD) and perceived risk and trust. The sample included 1,606 hunters in one of 10 northern Illinois counties with CWD, 1,958 hunters in a non-CWD county adjacent to these counties with CWD, and 2,099 hunters from the remaining non-CWD counties in Illinois. Compared to hunters in non-CWD counties, those in CWD counties were hypothesized to: (a) perceive more risk of CWD to humans, (b) perceive more risk of CWD to deer, (c) report less trust in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) CWD information, and (d) have less trust in the IDNR management of CWD. The first two hypotheses were not supported, as hunters in CWD counties perceived less risk to humans and deer than did respondents in non-CWD counties. Hunters in CWD counties, however, were less trusting of the IDNR information and management compared to the other hunters."

439767700023,AGING CELL,Social stress shortens lifespan in mice,"Stress and low socioeconomic status in humans confer increased vulnerability to morbidity and mortality. However, this association is not mechanistically understood nor has its causation been explored in animal models thus far. Recently, cellular senescence has been suggested as a potential mechanism linking lifelong stress to age-related diseases and shorter life expectancy in humans. Here, we established a causal role for lifelong social stress on shortening lifespan and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in mice. Specifically, we developed a lifelong chronic psychosocial stress model in which male mouse aggressive behavior is used to study the impact of negative social confrontations on healthspan and lifespan. C57BL/6J mice identified through unbiased cluster analysis for receiving high while exhibiting low aggression, or identified as subordinate based on an ethologic criterion, had lower median and maximal lifespan, and developed earlier onset of several organ pathologies in the presence of a cellular senescence signature. Critically, subordinate mice developed spontaneous early-stage atherosclerotic lesions of the aortic sinuses characterized by significant immune cells infiltration and sporadic rupture and calcification, none of which was found in dominant subjects. In conclusion, we present here the first rodent model to study and mechanistically dissect the impact of chronic stress on lifespan and disease of aging. These data highlight a conserved role for social stress and low social status on shortening lifespan and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in mammals and identify a potential mechanistic link for this complex phenomenon."
446035400001,FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY,Chinese Herbal Medicine Improves the Long-Term Survival Rate of Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease in Taiwan: A Nationwide Retrospective Population-Based Cohort Study,"Background and purpose: Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is frequently applied in conjunction with western pharmacotherapy to relieve symptoms in patients with CKD. However, evidence-based research into the effectiveness of CHM use as applied to treat CKD is limited and warrants further investigation. The aim of this study is to assess whether adjunctive treatment with CHM affected survival rate of CKD patients undergoing conventional western medical management. Methods: A total of 14,718 CKD patients, including 6,958 CHM users and 7,760 non-CHM users, were recruited from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000, a sub-dataset of the National Health Insurance Research Database, to conduct this study. Demographic characteristics, including sex, age, job type, residential area, and comorbidity were considered as covariates to adjust the analysis. A network analysis of treatments, including with herbal formulas and single herbs, was performed to investigate the core patterns of CHM use for the treatment of CKD patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the survival rate between CHM and non-CHM groups. Results: After matching for sex and age, there were 550 subjects in both the CHM and non-CHM cohorts. Other than presence of diabetes (adjusted OR = 0.57, p < 0.001) and urinary tract infection (adjusted OR = 0.69, p < 0.05), sex, age, job type, area of residence, and other comorbidities indicated no special preference for CHM use among subjects. Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (SM) and Ji-Sheng-Shen-Qi-Wan (JSSQW) were the most frequent single herb and formula, respectively, prescribed for patients with CKD. The most frequent CHM combination between herbs and formulas was JSSQW, associated with Rheum officinale Baill. (RO), SM and Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge (AM). The long-term survival rate demonstrated significant benefits for CHM users within a 12-year follow-up period (P < 0.004). Conclusion: This nationwide retrospective cohort study provides valuable insight into the characteristics and prescription patterns of CHM usage in CKD patients. JSSQW associated with RO, SM, and AM is the most common CHM prescription. CHM improves long-term survival in patients with CKD, suggesting that CHM is an effective adjuvant therapy for CKD."
457064800006,ICHNOS-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PLANT AND ANIMAL TRACES,History of Ichnology Tradition and Passing the Torch: The Cincinnati School of Ichnology,"The Cincinnati school of ichnology derives from a lineage of researchers whose work spans more than a century of excellent ichnological research. In the latter part of the 1800sstudying the trace-fossil-rich Paleozoic strata of the Cincinnati areaUriah James, Joseph James, Samuel Miller and Charles Dyer built the foundations of Cincinnati ichnology by collecting, cataloging and naming many fucoids that Joseph James later recognized to represent trace fossils and in some cases inorganic markings. Many of the ichnotaxa that these workers established are still valid.In the Twentieth Century, the Cincinnati school evolved through the work of Kenneth Caster, Richard Osgood and Wayne Pryor. These men contributed significantly to our modern view of ichnological principles. Using actualistic principles, Caster ably reinterpreted a range of trace fossils to represent limulid trackways, and revealed some stratigraphic aspects of trace fossil occurrence. Osgood conducted detailed analyses, provided superb descriptions and aptly engaged in ichnotaxonomy. Osgood understood that trace fossils represented the ethological activities of animals and even proposed that ethology should provide a basis for taxonomy. Most importantly, Osgood recognized the significance of Ediacaran trace-fossil diversification and prophetically postulated that key aspects of evolutionary history are preserved therein. Pryor employed actualistic studies of the sedimentary record, and integrated ichnological studies with sedimentology and stratigraphy in a profoundly modern manner, comparable to that undertaken by specialists today.The Cincinnati school research work was of such a quality that ensuing Cincinnati workers could rely heavily on this preceding work and so the efforts incrementally enlightened the field of ichnology. Importantly, all of these scientist were pedagogs: Uriah to his son Joseph and through his collaboration with Miller; Joseph James, a prodigious publisher and vocal critic of the classification of trace fossils as various seaweeds; Miller and Dyer, primarily as enthusiastic collection builders with high-quality published descriptions and who were avid fossil society participants; and Caster, Osgood and Pryor as academic teachers of the highest order, engaged in undergraduate and graduate student training, all of whom were recognized in various ways for their masterful teaching and training.The Cincinnati school is a fine example of the enduring influence that excellent collecting, describing, interpreting, documenting and especially teaching have in science. Even giants, it appears, can stand on the shoulders of giants and thus see even further."
440956100063,CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN,Controlled Heterogeneous Nucleation for Synthesis of Uniform Mesoporous Silica-Coated Gold Nanorods with Tailorable Rotational Diffusion and 1 nm-Scale Size Tunability,"We demonstrate a strategy for the synthesis of discrete and uniform gold nanorod (GNR)@mesoporous silica (mSiO(2)) core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) with finely tuned shell thickness by significantly suppressing the formation of undesired core-free NPs. We could control the thickness of the mSiO(2) shell with high precision, close to 1 nm, and hence the rotational diffusion mode of NPs by simply controlling the silica precursor injection times. The growth of the mSiO(2) shell on the GNR seeds and the formation of core-free mSiO(2) NPs could be explained by two models based on the modified LaMer's theory. Between these two, we found the most suitable one for the synthesis of GNR@mSiO(2) NPs with a precisely controlled shell thickness and negligible core-free NPs as the synthesis mostly occurs via heterogeneous nucleation on GNR seeds. As our results are very simple and highly reproducible, we expect this work to provide profound insights into the synthesis of a variety of heterogeneous nanostructures."
431987300019,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Bison body size and climate change,"The relationship between body size and temperature of mammals is poorly resolved, especially for large keystone species such as bison (Bison bison). Bison are well represented in the fossil record across North America, which provides an opportunity to relate body size to climate within a species. We measured the length of a leg bone (calcaneal tuber, DstL) in 849 specimens from 60 localities that were dated by stratigraphy and C-14 decay. We estimated body mass (M) as M=(DstL/11.49)(3). Average annual temperature was estimated from O-18 values in the ice cores from Greenland. Calcaneal tuber length of Bison declined over the last 40.000 years, that is, average body mass was 37% larger (910 +/- 50kg) than today (665 +/- 21kg). Average annual temperature has warmed by 6 degrees C since the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 24-18 kya) and is predicted to further increase by 4 degrees C by the end of the 21st century. If body size continues to linearly respond to global temperature, Bison body mass will likely decline by an additional 46%, to 357 +/- 54kg, with an increase of 4 degrees C globally. The rate of mass loss is 41 +/- 10kg per degrees C increase in global temperature. Changes in body size of Bison may be a result of migration, disease, or human harvest but those effects are likely to be local and short-term and not likely to persist over the long time scale of the fossil record. The strong correspondence between body size of bison and air temperature is more likely the result of persistent effects on the ability to grow and the consequences of sustaining a large body mass in a warming environment. Continuing rises in global temperature will likely depress body sizes of bison, and perhaps other large grazers, without human intervention."
429293500005,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS,Life history of abyssal and hadal fishes from otolith growth zones and oxygen isotopic compositions,"Hadal trenches are isolated habitats that cover the greatest ocean depths (6,500-11,000 m) and are believed to host high levels of endemism across multiple taxa. A group of apparent hadal endemics is within the snailfishes (Liparidae), found in at least five geographically separated trenches. Little is known about their biology, let alone the reasons for their success at hadal depths around the world. This study investigated the life history of hadal liparids using sagittal otoliths of two species from the Kermadec (Notoliparis kermadecensis) and Mariana (Pseudoliparis swirei) trenches in comparison to successful abyssal macrourids found at the abyssal-hadal transition zone. Otoliths for each species revealed alternating opaque and translucent growth zones that could be quantified in medial sections. Assuming these annuli represent annual growth, ages were estimated for the two hadal liparid species to be from five to 16 years old. These estimates were compared to the shallower-living snailfish Careproctus melanurus, which were older than described in previous studies, expanding the potential maximum age for the liparid family to near 25 years. Age estimates for abyssal macrourids ranged from eight to 29 years for Coryphaenoides armatus and six to 16 years for C. yaquinae. In addition, O-18/O-16 ratios (delta O-18) were measured across the otolith using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to investigate the thermal history of the three liparids, and two macrourids. Changes in delta O-18 values were observed across the otoliths of C. melanurus, C. armatus, and both hadal liparids, the latter of which may represent a change of > 5 degrees C in habitat temperature through ontogeny. The results would indicate there is a pelagic larval stage for the hadal liparids that rises to a depth above 1000 m, followed by a return to the hadal environment as these liparids grow. This result was unexpected for the hadal liparids given their isolated environment and large eggs, and the biological implications and plausibility of interpretations of these data are discussed. This study presents a first look at the life history of some of the deepest-living fishes through otolith analyses."
429709300001,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,Acquisition of pluripotency in the chick embryo occurs during intrauterine embryonic development via a unique transcriptional network,"Background: Acquisition of pluripotency by transcriptional regulatory factors is an initial developmental event that is required for regulation of cell fate and lineage specification during early embryonic development. The evolutionarily conserved core transcriptional factors regulating the pluripotency network in fishes, amphibians, and mammals have been elucidated. There are also species-specific maternally inherited transcriptional factors and their intricate transcriptional networks important in the acquisition of pluripotency. In avian species, however, the core transcriptional network that governs the acquisition of pluripotency during early embryonic development is not well understood. Results: We found that chicken NANOG (cNANOG) was expressed in the stages between the pre-ovulatory follicle and oocyte and was continuously detected in Eyal-Giladi and Kochav stage I (EGK.I) to X. However, cPOUV was not expressed during folliculogenesis, but began to be detectable between EGK.V and VI. Unexpectedly, cSOX2 could not be detected during folliculogenesis and intrauterine embryonic development. Instead of cSOX2, cSOX3 was maternally inherited and continuously expressed during chicken intrauterine development. In addition, we found that the pluripotency-related genes such as cENS-1, cKIT, cLIN28A, cMYC, cPRDM14, and cSALL4 began to be dramatically upregulated between EGK.VI and VIII. Conclusion: These results suggest that chickens have a unique pluripotent circuitry since maternally inherited cNANOG and cSOX3 may play an important role in the initial acquisition of pluripotency. Moreover, the acquisition of pluripotency in chicken embryos occurs at around EGK.VI to VIII."
453491700003,RADIATION MEASUREMENTS,Study of fluence and dose spatial distributions in phantoms with various shapes exposed to epithermal neutrons for NCT,"The various dose components generated by epithermal neutron beams in tissue-equivalent materials have different spatial distributions that also depend on the size and volume of the irradiated volume. NCT dosimetry requires the separate determination of dose components having different LET, because of their different RBE. Monte Carlo simulations have been developed concerning the absorbed doses and thermal neutron fluences, to investigate the extent of the differences that may occur by changing the shape and size of the irradiated volumes. Moreover, the doses and fluences that occur if specific isotopes (B-10, N-14 Gd-157) are added to water have been evaluated."
444357600010,JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER,On localized approximations for Laguerre-Gauss beams focused by a lens,"When dealing with T-matrix methods for structured beams, e.g. Generalized Lorenz-Mie Theories (GLMTs) or Extended Boundary Condition Method (EBCM), the description of the illuminating beam is encoded by a set of coefficients named Beam Shape Coefficients (BSCs). An efficient method to evaluate the BSCs is by using a localized approximation. In a series of papers, we demonstrated that any existing localized approximation is of limited validity (i) in the case of beams exhibiting a propagation factor of the form exp(ikzcos alpha), in which alpha may be called the axicon angle, such as zeroth-order Bessel beams, or (ii) in the case of beams exhibiting a topological charge term, such as Laguerre-Gauss beams propagating freely in space. In the present paper, we consider the case of Laguerre-Gauss beams focused by a lens which exhibit both an axicon angle and a topological charge, and demonstrate that any existing localized approximation should be used with caution as well in this case in contrast with results, available from the literature, in which an integral localized approximation has been used to evaluate the BSCs of such beams.

425565300015,INFORMATION SCIENCES,Differential evolution with adaptive trial vector generation strategy and cluster-replacement-based feasibility rule for constrained optimization,"Constrained optimization problems (COPs) are common in many fields. To solve such problems effectively, in this paper, we propose a new constrained optimization evolutionary algorithm (COEA) named CACDE that combines an adaptive trial vector generation strategy based differential evolution (DE) algorithm with a cluster-replacement-based feasibility rule. In CACDE, some potential mutation strategies, scale factors and crossover rates are stored in candidate pools, and each element in the pools is assigned a selection probability. During the trial vector generation stage, the mutation strategy, scale factor and crossover rate for each target vector are competitively determined based on these selection probabilities. Meanwhile, the selection probabilities are dynamically updated based on statistical information learned from previous searches in generating improved solutions. Moreover, to alleviate the greediness of the feasibility rule, the main population is divided into several clusters, and one vector in each cluster is conditionally replaced with an archived infeasible vector with a low objective value. The superior performance of CACDE is validated via comparisons with some state-of-the-art COEAs over 2 sets of artificial problems and 5 widely used mechanical design problems. The results show that CACDE is an effective approach for solving COPs, basically due to the use of adaptive DE and cluster-replacement based feasibility rule. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

437270800017,CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH,Concurrent Alterations in EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancers Associated with Resistance to EGFR Kinase Inhibitors and Characterization of MTOR as a Mediator of Resistance,"Purpose: To identify molecular factors that determine duration of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and to identify novel mechanisms of drug resistance, we molecularly profiled EGFR-mutant tumors prior to treatment and after progression on EGFR TKI using targeted next-generation sequencing. Experimental Design: Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed on 374 consecutive patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Clinical data were collected and correlated with somatic mutation data. Erlotinib resistance due to acquired MTOR mutation was functionally evaluated by in vivo and in vitro studies. Results: In 200 EGFR-mutant pretreatment samples, the most frequent concurrent alterations were mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, CTNNB1, and RB1 and focal amplifications in EGFR, TTF1, MDM2, CDK4, and FOXA1. Shorter time to progression on EGFR TKI was associated with amplification of ERBB2 (HR = 2.4, P = 0.015) or MET (HR = 3.7, P = 0.019), or mutation in TP53 (HR = 1.7, P = 0.006). In the 136 post-treatment samples, we identified known mechanisms of acquired resistance: EGFR T790M (51%), MET (7%), and ERBB2 amplifications (5%). In the 38 paired samples, novel acquired alterations representing putative resistance mechanisms included BRAF fusion, FGFR3 fusion, YES1 amplification, KEAP1 loss, and an MTOR E2419K mutation. Functional studies confirmed the contribution of the latter to reduced sensitivity to EGFR TKI in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: EGFR-mutant lung cancers harbor a spectrum of concurrent alterations that have prognostic and predictive significance. By utilizing paired samples, we identified several novel acquired alterations that may be relevant in mediating resistance, including an activating mutation in MTOR further validated functionally.

431815800038,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,Forest cover changes in Gorce NP (Poland) using photointerpretation of analogue photographs and GEOBIA of orthophotos and nDSM based on image-matching based approach,"Forest cover change can be detected with high precision using 3D geospatial data and semi-automatic analyses of Remote Sensing data. The aim of our study, performed in Gorce National Park in Poland, was to generate a land use land cover (LULC) map and use it to analyse forest cover change. The study area is a subalpine forest region that has been affected by bark beetle and wind disturbances. The Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis approach was used for classification, with Colour Infrared orthophotos and normalized Digital Surface Models generated using image-matching approach. Gathered results showed that dominating LULC class is coniferous forests (3380 ha; 47% of study area), when second largest class is deciduous forests (2204 ha; 30%). The dead Norway spruce stands (465.5 ha; 6.5%) showed significant increase comparing to 114.1 ha mapped in 1997."
448836700016,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY,PI3K expression predicts overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma,"Background: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K) is considered a hallmark in tumor initiation and progression, but its prognostic value in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial. Methods: In the present study, we included 118 NSCLC tissue samples and 13 adjacent normal lung tissue specimens. Immunohistochemical staining was applied to test PI3K/p-PI3K expression. Pearson Chi-squared test and Kaplan-Meier curve were conducted to analyze its correlation with both clinicopathological features and prognosis in NSCLC patients. Results: PI3K/p-PI3K expression in lung cancer tissue differed significantly from that of normal lung tissue (P < 0.001). M stage was significantly correlated to PI3K expression (P = 0.037), but no significant association was found between p-PI3K expression and clinical characteristics. Neither PI3K nor p-PI3K were correlated to overall survival of NSCLC patients (P = 0.105 and P = 0.190, respectively). However, it was found in subgroup analysis that lung adenocarcinoma patients with positive PI3K expression had a favorable survival (P = 0.043). Notably, this correlation was determined invalid in subsequent multivariate analysis (P = 0.052). Conclusions: PI3K could predict the overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients, but failed to be an independent prognostic predictor."
446151500004,MARINE STRUCTURES,Quasi-static and dynamic indentation of offshore pipelines with and without multi-layer polymeric coating,"Offshore pipelines are occasionally subjected to accidental impact loads from trawl gear or anchors, which may damage the pipe. In this study, a series of indentation experiments carried out on offshore steel pipes covered by a multi-layer polymeric coating solution is presented. Polymeric coating solutions are often applied to pipelines to act as corrosion protection and thermal insulation. Despite not being designed for it, the polymeric coatings are experienced to have an energy absorbing capacity, which is the main topic of the investigation herein. In design codes and guidelines, coatings are traditionally not accounted for when determining the energy absorbed by a pipeline during impact. This makes estimates overly conservative. The main goal of this experimental work is thus to investigate the contribution a typical polymeric coating makes to the energy absorption in a pipeline during impact. To this end, a series of indentation experiments carried out on offshore steel pipes covered by a multi-layer polymeric coating solution is performed. The test program includes quasi-static and dynamic denting experiments on both coated and uncoated fullscale pipe cross-sections. All pipes tested have a length of approximately 1 m. The sharpest indenter from the relevant guidelines is used, as a sharp indenter is more likely to penetrate the coating compared with a blunter one. Based on the outcome of the tests, the polymeric coating is found to absorb a considerable amount of the kinetic energy delivered by an impacting object."
424396200017,CLINICAL CHEMISTRY,Noninvasive Prenatal Diagnosis of Single-Gene Disorders by Use of Droplet Digital PCR,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal diagnosis in pregnancies at risk of single-gene disorders is currently performed using invasive methods such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. This is in contrast with screening for common aneuploidies, for which noninvasive methods with a single maternal blood sample have become standard clinical practice. METHODS: We developed a protocol for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of inherited single-gene disorders using droplet digital PCR from circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma. First, the amount of cfDNA and fetal fraction is determined using a panel of TaqMan assays targeting high-variability single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Second, the ratio of healthy and diseased alleles in maternal plasma is quantified using TaqMan assays targeting the mutations carried by the parents. Two validation approaches of the mutation assay are presented. RESULTS: We collected blood samples from 9 pregnancies at risk for different single-gene disorders, including common conditions and rare metabolic disorders. We measured cases at risk of hemophilia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, mevalonate kinase deficiency, acetylcholine receptor deficiency, and DFNB1 nonsyndromic hearing loss. We correctly differentiated affected and unaffected pregnancies (2 affected, 7 unaffected), confirmed by neonatal testing. We successfully measured an affected pregnancy as early as week 11 and with a fetal fraction as low as 3.7% (0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our method detects single-nucleotide mutations of autosomal recessive diseases as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. This is of importance for metabolic disorders in which early diagnosis can affect management of the disease and reduce complications and anxiety related to invasive testing.

432567700007,JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,Constraint Programming Approach to Optimizing Project Schedules under Material Logistics and Crew Availability Constraints,"With increasing implementation of off-site prefabrication and modular construction technologies, the complexity of material supply chain management on construction projects has grown substantially. However, research on construction scheduling has yet to take dynamic material logistics as an explicit constraint in analytically deriving construction schedules and addressing impacts of uncertainties in material supply on project budget. This study proposes a two-step analytical approach to tackle the identified problem. First, a constraint programming-based scheduling optimization model is developed to derive project schedules subject to variable material delivery times and finite crew resource availability. The second step is to take advantage of the valid optimization model for evaluating the impact of different input settings of material logistics on project budget. An example project adapted from the literature is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization model in coping with variable material delivery times. Based on the same case, the delivery date of a particular material is singled out as the risk factor of interest in order to derive the complex relationship between material delivery date and total project cost. In addition, a case study based on a bridge girder fabrication project is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed optimization model on projects of practical size. In conclusion, this study adds to the body of knowledge by developing an analytical methodology that factors material supply constraints into the resource-constrained scheduling optimization model so as to analyze the impact of uncertainties in material deliveries on project budget."
452310700008,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,Decrease in musculoskeletal pain after 4 and 12 months of an aerobic exercise intervention: a worksite RCT among cleaners,"Background: Prevalence of musculoskeletal pain is high in jobs with high physical work demands. An aerobic exercise intervention targeting cardiovascular health was evaluated for its long term side effects on musculoskeletal pain. Objective: The objective was to investigate if aerobic exercise affects level of musculoskeletal pain from baseline to 4- and 12-months follow-up. Methods: One-hundred-and-sixteen cleaners aged 18-65 years were cluster-randomized. The aerobic exercise group (n = 57) received worksite aerobic exercise (30 min twice a week) and the reference group (n = 59) lectures in health promotion. Strata were formed according to closest manager (total 11 strata); clusters were set within strata (total 40 clusters, 20 in each group). Musculoskeletal pain data from eight body regions was collected at baseline and after 4- and 12-months follow-up. The participants stated highest pain in the last month on a scale from 0, stating no pain, up to 10, stating worst possible pain. A repeated-measure 2 x 2 multi-adjusted mixed-models design was applied to compare the between-groups differences in an intention to treat analysis. Participants were entered as a random effect nested in clusters to account for the cluster-based randomization. Results: Clinically significant reductions (>30%, f (2) > 0.25) in the aerobic exercise group, compared to the reference group, in pain intensity in neck, shoulders, arms/wrists were found at 12-months follow-up, and a tendency (p = 0.07, f (2) = 0.18) to an increase for the knees. At 4-months follow-up the only significant between-group change was an increase in hip pain. Conclusions: This study indicates that aerobic exercise reduces musculoskeletal pain in the upper extremities, but as an unintended side effect may increase pain in the lower extremities. Aerobic exercise interventions among workers standing or walking in the majority of the working hours should tailor exercise to only maintain the positive effect on musculoskeletal pain."

In the TURQUOISE-II/-III trials, a 12-week regimen of the direct-acting antiviral agents ombitasvir (OBV), paritaprevir (PTV), ritonavir, and dasabuvir (DSV) in GT1b-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis resulted in 12-week sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 100%. Patients and methods In TURQUOISE-IV, GT1b-infected patients (n = 36) from Russia and Belarus with compensated cirrhosis, who were treatment naive or previously treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (RBV), received OBV/PTV/ritonavir + DSV + RBV for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was SVR at 12 weeks. Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) monitoring and laboratory testing. Results At baseline, patients had Child-Pugh scores of 5 (92%) or 6 (8%). Overall, 69% were treatment experienced (44% prior null responders, 32% relapsers, and 16% partial responders). All patients achieved SVR at 12 weeks (36/36; 100%). No patient experienced a serious AE or discontinued treatment prematurely. Treatment-emergent AEs possibly related to study drugs occurring in greater than or equal to 10% of patients were asthenia (19%), anemia (14%), cough (14%), and headache (11%); most events were mild in severity. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were infrequent. Conclusion In Russian and Belarusian patients with hepatitis C GT1b infection and compensated cirrhosis, 100% achieved SVR at 12 weeks after 12 weeks' treatment with OBV/PTV/ritonavir + DSV + RBV. The treatment was well tolerated. Copyright (C) 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

425893000057,JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY,Mixing of Head-Stem Components in Total Hip Arthroplasty,"Background: Implant manufacturers proclaim that the tapers of modular total hip arthroplasty are not standardized and can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. That is why the combination of various components from different manufacturers (""Mix and Match"") is not permitted. In this study, different taper combinations were investigated experimentally to assess the effect of ""Mix and Match"" regarding the taper connection strength. Methods: Torque-off tests using hip stems and metal femoral heads from 6 different implant manufacturers were performed. First the components were tested as intended and afterwards the stems were combined with metal heads from other manufacturers. Results: There was no significant difference in taper connection strength when stems from the manufacturers Link, Smith & Nephew, and Zimmer were combined with heads from other manufacturers. The Biomet stems showed a significantly reduced taper connection strength if femoral heads of Aesculap, DePuy, or Smith & Nephew were used. On the contrary, the DePuy stems in combination with the originally intended femoral heads showed a significantly lower taper connection strength compared to the use of heads from Link, Biomet, and Zimmer. The same was observed for the Aesculap stems in combination with Zimmer heads. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that mixing components from different manufacturers may affect the taper connection strength and could reduce the stability. As safety should be a high priority in patient treatment, any potential risks should be avoided. Therefore, mixing and matching of heads and femoral stems from different manufacturers cannot be recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

445543500024,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,Mental Health Literacy in Young Adults: Adaptation and Psychometric Properties of the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire,"Mental health literacy (MHL) is considered a prerequisite for early recognition and intervention in mental disorders, and for this reason, it has become a focus of research over the past few decades. Assessing this construct is relevant for identifying knowledge gaps and erroneous beliefs concerning mental health issues, to inform the development of interventions aimed at promoting mental health literacy as well as the evaluation of these interventions. Recently, we developed a new self-reporting measure (MHLq) for assessing mental health literacy in young people (12-14 years-old), meeting the need to assess MHL from a comprehensive perspective of the construct instead of focusing on a restricted number of mental disorders or specific dimensions (e.g., knowledge concerning specific disorders; stigma). The present study aimed to adapt the MHLq for the young adult population and to examine its psychometric properties, according to the following steps: (1) item adaptation, using a think aloud procedure (n = 5); (2) data collection (n = 356, aged between 18 and 25 years old; and (3) psychometric analyses (exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency analysis). The final version of the questionnaire included 29 items (total scale alpha = 0.84), organized by four dimensions: (1) knowledge of mental health problems (alpha = 0.74); (2) erroneous beliefs/stereotypes (alpha = 0.72); (3) help-seeking and first aid skills (alpha = 0.71); and (4) self-help strategies (alpha = 0.60). The results suggest that the MHLq-adult form is a practical, valid, and reliable screening tool for identifying gaps in knowledge, beliefs, and behavioral intentions related to mental health and mental disorders, planning promotion programs, and evaluating intervention effectiveness."
419464400010,JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS,Development of chondrocyte-seeded electrosprayed nanoparticles for repair of articular cartilage defects in rabbits,"Due to limited self-healing capacity in cartilages, there is a rising demand for an innovative therapy that promotes chondrocyte proliferation while maintaining its biofunctionality for transplantation. Chondrocyte transplantation has received notable attention; however, the tendencies of cell de-differentiation and de-activation of biofunctionality have been major hurdles in its development, delaying this therapy from reaching the clinic. We believe it is due to the non-stimulative environment in the injured cartilage, which is unable to provide sustainable physical and biological supports to the newly grafted chondrocytes. Therefore, we evaluated whether providing an appropriate matrix to the transplanted chondrocytes could manipulate cell fate and recovery outcomes. Here, we proposed the development of electrosprayed nanoparticles composed of cartilage specific proteins, namely collagen type II and hyaluronic acid, for implantation with pre-seeded chondrocytes into articular cartilage defects. The fabricated nanoparticles were pre-cultured with chondrocytes before implantation into injured articular cartilage. The study revealed a significant potential for nanoparticles to support pre-seeded chondrocytes in cartilage repair, serving as a protein delivery system while improving the survival and biofunctionality of transplanted chondrocytes for prolonged period of time."
423029300019,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,Adaptive feeding behavior and functional responses in zooplankton,"Zooplankton may modify their feeding behavior in response to prey availability and presence of predators with implications to populations of both predators and prey. Optimal foraging theory predicts that such responses result in a type II functional response for passive foragers and a type III response for active foragers, with the latter response having a stabilizing effect on prey populations. Here, we test the theoretical predictions and the underlying mechanisms in pelagic copepods that are actively feeding (feeding-current feeders), passively feeding (ambushers), or that can switch between the two feeding modes. In all cases, individual behaviors are consistent with the resulting functional response. Passive ambushing copepods have invariant foraging behavior and a type II functional response, as predicted. When foraging actively, the species with switching capability change its functional response from type II to III and modify its foraging effort in response to prey density and predation risk, also as predicted by theory. The obligate active feeders, however, follow a type II response inconsistent with the theoretical prediction. A survey of the literature similarly finds consistent type II response in ambush feeding copepods, but variable (II or III) responses in active feeders. We examine reasons for why observed behaviors at times deviate from predictions, and discuss the population dynamics and food web implications of the two types of functional responses and their underlying mechanisms."
445314200010,JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES,How can we improve process hazard identification? What can accident investigation methods contribute and what other recent developments? A brief historical survey and a sketch of how to advance,"Risk assessment is essential for various purposes such as facility siting, safeguarding, and licensing. Hazard identification (HAZID), which suffers greatly from incompleteness, is still the weakest link in risk assessment. Of course, this recognition is not new and many efforts have been spent to improve the situation, of which some have been rather successful. To find out what can go wrong, creative divergent thinking is required. Hazard identification should result in scenario definition. In that respect, applying the present tools as HAZOP and FMEA there is still a great emphasis on the material and equipment aspects. In contrast, underlying management and leadership failure in its many forms reflecting in organizational and human failure, due to complexity, attracts much less attention. Unlike in HAZID, in accident investigation the occurrence of an event with nasty consequences is no doubt a fact, so there must be one or more causes and the traces will lead to them. Over the years, methods for accident and incident investigation have gone through a significant evolution. From the early-on simplistic domino stone model and the human operator always at fault, via models of latent failure due to failing management involvement and via extensive root cause analysis (RCA) to a system approach. Hence, in accident investigation, management failure appearing in the many possible forms of human and organizational factors, obtained already 30 years ago with the RCA technique much attention, while it nowadays culminates in the socio-technical system approach. So, the question arises whether for improved HAZID we can learn from the accident investigation experience. In addition, safer design and advances from static risk assessment towards more accurate predictive operational dynamic risk assessment and management, will also be enabled by possibilities offered by big data and analytics. Digitization, automation and simulation, hence computerization, will be of great help in improving the identification of hazards and tracing the corresponding scenarios. The paper reviews the developmental history of both accident investigation and hazard identification methodology; incidentally it will identify commonality and differences. On the basis of the comparison and of recent advances in computerization, the paper will investigate to what extent beneficial modifications and additions can be made to obtain a higher degree of completeness in HAZID."
447571300010,PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS,Alterations in the metabolic and cardiorespiratory response to exercise in Huntington's Disease,"Background: Limited data suggests that an altered metabolic and cardiorespiratory exercise response may affect exercise performance in individuals with Huntington's disease (HD). There is no clear exploration of the response in individuals at different stages of the disease or in relation to genetic markers. This study aimed to examine the exercise response and recovery of HD participants, and the relationship to genetic and clinical markers. Method: HD gene-positive participants (n = 31; 9 pre-manifest; 22 manifest HD) and a healthy control group (n = 29) performed an incremental exercise test until exhaustion. Performance, cardiorespiratory, metabolic and perceptual responses to exercise were determined from a maximal cycle ergometer test throughout the exercise test and during a recovery period. Results: During sub-maximal exercise, metabolic (lactate levels, oxygen uptake) and cardiorespiratory markers (heart rate) were elevated in HD participants compared to controls. Lactate elevation was specific to pre manifest HD participants. Work capacity was reduced in both pre-manifest and manifest HD participants with tests terminated with no difference in metabolic, perceptual or cardiorespiratory markers. Submaximal oxygen uptake was correlated with motor score, whilst peak measures were unrelated to genetic or clinical markers. Heart rate recovery was attenuated in pre-manifest and manifest HD participants. Conclusions: Our findings confirm metabolic and cardiorespiratory deficits reduce exercise performance and affect recovery from an early stage in HD, with submaximal deficits related to phenotypic expression. Exercise capacity appears to be limited by an altered movement economy, thus clinicians should consider an altered exercise response and recovery may affect prescription in HD."
445980700006,SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE,'Do you know how to use a condom?' - UK nurse practitioners' conversation about men and family planning,"Introduction: Health professionals have been identified as central to encouraging men to take an active part in family planning. The aim of this article is to understand nurse practitioners' conversations about men as family planning patients. Methods: One-to-one, semi-structured interviews were conducted with five nurse practitioners. Nurses interviewed worked in a northern UK student medical practice serving over 34,000 students with a diverse range of ages and demographic backgrounds (both home and overseas students). The research method was qualitative using discourse analysis. Results: After completing the analysis, two discourses emerged. Discourse one, family planning services are culturally female centric, and discourse two, condom use by male family planning patients is problematic. Discussion: Implications for how nurse practitioners can continue to play an important part when providing care to male family planning patients is discussed, specifically in relation to culture and condom efficacy."
429474200005,CORPUS LINGUISTICS AND LINGUISTIC THEORY,Log-likelihood and odds ratio: Keyness statistics for different purposes of keyword analysis,"Keyword analysis is used in a range of sub-disciplines of applied linguistics from genre analyses to critically-oriented studies for different purposes ranging from producing a general characterization of a genre to identifying text-specific ideological issues. This study compares the use of log-likelihood (LL), a probability statistic, and odds ratio (OR), an effect size statistic, for keyword identification and argues that the two methods produce different keywords applicable to research focusing on different purposes. Through two case studies, keyword analyses of advance fee scams against the British National Corpus and research articles in applied linguistics against research articles from other academic disciplines, we show that both the LL and OR keywords concern the aboutness of the corpus, but differ in their specificity and pervasiveness through the corpus. LL highlights words which are relatively common in general use serving genre purposes, whereas OR highlights more specialized words serving critically-oriented purposes. Methodological and practical contributions to keyword analysis are discussed."
446807700005,POSTEPY MIKROBIOLOGII,The role of Campylobacter jejuni infection in the development of Guillain-Barre Syndrome,"Campylobacter spp. are Gram-negative, spiral, thermophilic, motile bacteria, which require microaerophilic environment for growth. They have restricted carbohydrate catabolism, but have well-developed mechanism of acquiring micronutrients instead. A common problem, especially in developing countries, is campylobacteriosis, mostly caused by Campylobacter jejuni. The major reason of this disease is the increasing resistance of these bacteria to commonly used antibiotics. The most frequent source of infection is poorly cooked poultry meat. Despite numerous cases of campylobacteriosis, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. However, the role of bacterial motility, adhesion, ability to invade hosts intestinal epithelial cells and secretion of toxins have been found significant. In addition to developing gastrointestinal infections, C. jejuni is firmly established as a causative agent of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which is an autoimmune-mediated demyelinating polyneuropathy of peripheral nerves. Molecular mimicry between bacterial surface structures and hosts gangliosides is responsible for the development of this disease. The serious local and systemic consequences of C. jejuni infections are the reason for monitoring the microbial purity of food, especially meat and drinking water, for C jejuni contamination, necessitating also new approaches to contamination prevention or minimization."
430520200017,WATER RESEARCH,Biological performance and sludge filterability of anaerobic membrane bioreactors under nitrogen limited and supplied conditions,"The impact of nitrogen on biological performance and sludge filterability of anaerobic membrane bioreactors was investigated in two lab-scale cross-flow anaerobic membrane bioreactors that were fed with cheese whey at two different COD:TKN ratios (50 and 190). Nitrogen deprivation adversely affected the biological treatment performance and reactor stability, as indicated by volatile fatty acids accumulation. On the other hand, nitrogen (urea) supplementation resulted in a reduced sludge median particle size and decreased sludge filterability. Standard filterability parameters such as capillary suction time and specific resistance to filtration tended to rapidly increase in the nitrogen supplemented reactor. The critical fluxes in the nitrogen limited and supplemented reactors were 20 and 9 L m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The rapid deterioration of sludge filterability under nitrogen supplemented conditions was attributed to abundant growth of dispersed biomass. Thus, the COD:TKN ratio of wastewater affected both bioconversion and filterability performance in the anaerobic membrane bioreactors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
424864200009,JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL & DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY,Biographical disruption: Experiences of mothers of adults assessed for autism spectrum disorder,"Background Little is known about the experiences of parents whose sons or daughters are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during adulthood. Method In this exploratory study, 6 mothers of adults recently diagnosed with ASD were interviewed about the ASD assessment process. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interviews. Results Two superordinate themes are described: (1) biographical continuity, and (2) biographical disruption. Mothers did not experience significant disruption around the ASD assessment itself, as they had sought an explanation for their son's/daughter's behaviour since childhood. Therefore, being referred for an ASD assessment was simply another assessment for their son or daughter and was thus a biographical continuity. Mothers experienced biographical disruption once an ASD diagnosis was received, as they realised that an ASD diagnosis did not result in any additional support, and found this greatly frustrating. Conclusions There is an unmet need for postdiagnostic support among adults diagnosed with ASD, and for their parents."
447750200020,NEUROIMAGE,TractSeg - Fast and accurate white matter tract segmentation,"The individual course of white matter fiber tracts is an important factor for analysis of white matter characteristics in healthy and diseased brains. Diffusion-weighted MRI tractography in combination with region-based or clustering-based selection of streamlines is a unique combination of tools which enables the in-vivo delineation and analysis of anatomically well-known tracts. This, however, currently requires complex, computationally intensive processing pipelines which take a lot of time to set up. TractSeg is a novel convolutional neural network-based approach that directly segments tracts in the field of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) peaks without using tractography, image registration or parcellation. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is much faster than existing methods while providing unprecedented accuracy, using a population of 105 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. We also show initial evidence that TractSeg is able to generalize to differently acquired data sets for most of the bundles. The code and data are openly available at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg/ and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1088277, respectively."

The hydrocolloids viz., agar (1-3g), pectin (1-3g), and polydextrose (24-28g) were optimized [mixture design (MD)] to obtain hydrocolloid mix (HM) with a soft texture. Next, whole jamun ingredients viz, jamun pulp (JP) (20-30g), seed powder (JSP) (1-5g), and HM (25-35g) were optimized (MD+PCA) for satisfactory texture, total polyphenolic content (TPC), and fruity hedonics. The optimized WJC was assayed for GI and modelled by univariate kinetics and MASLT (10-45 degrees C/75% humidity/120days). Using MASLT, the collated effects of quality attributes (anthocyanin content, TPC, moisture, hardness, and total color change) were extracted as principal components to estimate new stability parameters viz, multivariate rate constants (k(m)), acceleration factors (aT m), activation energy (Eam), and cut- off criterion. The optimized WJC contains 2.3 g agar, 1.9 g pectin, 27.2 g polydextrose, 26.4 g JP, and 2 g JSP and had satisfactory hardness (1007 g), TPC (2.8 mg gallic acid equivalents/g), and low GI value (48.6). The zero- order kinetic fitting of univariate versus MASLT resulted in aT o45; 10thorn, Ea, and shelf life (10 C) of 7.8 versus 6.2, 43.81 versus 39.22 kJ/mol and 175 versus 186 days, respectively. MASLT simplified the kinetic interpretations to a single variable by collating the useful information from critical quality parameters and predicted shelf life precisely than univariate kinetics."
444058300063,JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS,Influence of Al2O3 nanoparticles on the corrosion behavior of brass in simulated cooling water,"The influence of Al2O3 nanoparticles on the corrosion behavior of brass in simulated cooling water (SCW) with or without sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) was investigated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, polarization curves, scanning electron microscope, energy spectrum analysis, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Results indicate that the brass suffered severe corrosion in SCW and the SCW-Al2O3 nanofluid. The main corrosion product was Zn-5(OH)(6)(CO3)(2). Al2O3 nanoparticles promoted both anodic and cathodic processes in the brass electrode, and dezincification was most serious in the SCW-Al2O3 nanofluid. The adsorption of SDBS on the brass surface was enhanced, and a more compact protective film was formed on the brass surface in the SCW-Al2O3-SDBS nanofluid. As a result, the corrosion resistance of brass was increased in this medium. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
452003400009,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Excitonic complexes in anisotropic atomically thin two-dimensional materials: Black phosphorus and TiS3,"The effect of anisotropy in the energy spectrum on the binding energy and structural properties of excitons, trions, and biexcitons is investigated. To this end we employ the stochastic variational method with a correlated Gaussian basis. We present results for the binding energy of different excitonic complexes in black phosphorus (bP) and TiS3 and compare them with recent results in the literature when available, for which we find good agreement. The binding energies of excitonic complexes in bP are larger than those in TiS3. We calculate the different average interparticle distances in bP and TiS3 and show that excitonic complexes in bP are strongly anisotropic whereas in TiS3 they are almost isotropic, even though the constituent particles have an anisotropic energy spectrum. This is also confirmed by the correlation functions."
430785500033,COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING,Efficiency decomposition and measurement in two-stage fuzzy DEA models using a bargaining game approach,"In this paper, a fuzzy two-stage Game-DEA (FTSGDEA) approach is proposed using a bargaining game model. Each decision-making unit (DMU) consists of two serially connected sub-DMUs. The first sub-DMU uses several inputs to produce several outputs. The outputs of the first sub-DMU, called intermediated measures, are the inputs of the second sub-DMU. Intermediate measures are used by the second sub-DMU to produce the final output of the main DMU. In standard TSGDEA settings, the product of the distance of the efficiency scores of each sub-DMU, which defines its breakdown payoff, is maximized. This approach leads to the overall enhancement of the efficiency scores through a cooperative game environment. We extend this setting to a fuzzy environment where the uncertainty of inputs, intermediate measures, and outputs is accounted for using linguistic terms parameterized via fuzzy sets. The proposed FTSGDEA associates an interval efficiency score to each DMU and sub-DMU, which allows the model to handle real-life problems involving uncertainties. We apply FTSGDEA to a case study involving the assessment of sixty branches from the Saman bank in Iran."
445521800030,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,"Biosystematic revision of the native and naturalised species of Rubus L. (Rosaceae) in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa","Rubus L. is a highly diverse and taxonomically complex genus with a worldwide distribution. Although southern Africa is not a major centre of Rubus diversity, a number of indigenous and naturalised taxa have been recorded from the region, although their taxonomy, nomenclature and evolution are either confused or poorly studied at best. This paper represents the first results of a wider project focusing on the biosystematics of the southern African Rubus flora, and presents a taxonomic revision of the brambles of the Cape Floristic Region, including an estimation of ploidy levels. A total of eight taxa are recognised, including the two indigenous taxa R. pinnatus and R. rigidus agg., the four introduced species R. armeniacus, R. bergii, R. rosifolius and R. titanus, and two hybrids between indigenous and introduced taxa. Rubus rigidus agg. is an unresolved and variable species complex with at least two ploidy levels (5x, 6x). The hybrid taxon R. bergii x R. rigidus appears to be wide-spread and behaves as an independent apomictic complex. In addition, hybridization between R. bergii and R. pinnatus is relatively common in the contact zones between the two species. The two introductions Rubus armeniacus and R. titanus are recorded from South Africa for the first time. The invasive potential of the introduced species is regarded as low but the potential for hybridization by R. bergii seems to be high. An identification key, morphological descriptions, and notes on nomenclature, distribution and ecology are provided, and all taxa are illustrated. (c) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

425935100002,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Functionally distinct disease-associated fibroblast subsets in rheumatoid arthritis,"Fibroblasts regulate tissue homeostasis, coordinate inflammatory responses, and mediate tissue damage. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), synovial fibroblasts maintain chronic inflammation which leads to joint destruction. Little is known about fibroblast heterogeneity or if aberrations in fibroblast subsets relate to pathology. Here, we show functional and transcriptional differences between fibroblast subsets from human synovial tissues using bulk transcriptomics of targeted subpopulations and single-cell transcriptomics. We identify seven fibroblast subsets with distinct surface protein phenotypes, and collapse them into three subsets by integrating transcriptomic data. One fibroblast subset, characterized by the expression of proteins podoplanin, THY1 membrane glycoprotein and cadherin-11, but lacking CD34, is threefold expanded in patients with RA relative to patients with osteoarthritis. These fibroblasts localize to the perivascular zone in inflamed synovium, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, are proliferative, and have an in vitro phenotype characteristic of invasive cells. Our strategy may be used as a template to identify pathogenic stromal cellular subsets in other complex diseases."
431193400011,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE,Liquid jet trajectory and droplet path influenced by combined cross flow and electric fields,"This study investigates an ethanol liquid jet subjected to combination of an air crossflow and a normal electric field. The results on the liquid jet trajectory and subsequent droplets flight paths are presented. The liquid jet trajectory was found as a function of two non-dimensional quantities; the liquid jet to the crossflow momentum ratio and the electroinertial number. The electroinertial number is defined as the ratio between the liquid jet specific momentum and the electric force. A correlation is introduced for the jet trajectory in low crossflow speeds and electric field intensities. The same two quantities control the detached droplets flight paths. Satellite droplets flight angles are also reported with a correlation for their separation angle, which can be useful in applications where uniform droplet production is important.

443085800012,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION,Analysis and Comparative Study of Flux Weakening Capability in Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings,"This paper presents a detailed investigation of the winding inductance and the flux weakening capability in fractional-slot motors equipped with concentrated windings. An analytical model has been developed for evaluating the winding inductance by merging existent theories. Subsequently, a simple factor called weakening factor, which is proportional to the d-axis inductance and the pole pair, has been introduced to indicate the level of the flux weakening capability for different pole/slot combinations in the case where the air gap or slot leakage inductance is the dominant component. From the comparative study, it is shown that the multiple 4-pole/3-slot, i.e., S-pp = 1/4, can have the highest flux weakening capability resulting from the highest air gap inductance. The experimental results from several prototype motors, together with finite element analysis, are employed to confirm the validity of key analyses discussed in the paper."
443329500112,JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,Model Surgical Training: Skills Acquisition in Fetoscopic Laser Photocoagulation of Monochorionic Diamniotic Twin Placenta Using Realistic Simulators,"Fetoscopic laser coagulation of arterio-venous anastomoses (AVA) in a monochorionic placenta is the standard of care for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), but is technically challenging and can lead to significant complications. Acquiring and maintaining the necessary surgical skills require consistent practice, a critical caseload, and time. Training on realistic surgical simulators can potentially shorten this steep learning curve and enables several proceduralists to acquire procedure-specific skills simultaneously. Here we describe realistic simulators designed to allow the user familiarity with the equipment and specific steps required in the surgical treatment of TTTS, including fetoscopic handling, approaches to anterior and posterior placenta, recognition of anastomoses, and efficient coagulation of vessels. We describe the skills that are especially important in conducting placental laser coagulation that the surgeon can practice on the model and apply in a clinical case. These models can be adapted easily depending on the availability of materials and require standard fetoscopy equipment. Such training systems are complementary to traditional surgical apprenticeships and can be useful aids for fetal medicine units that provide this clinical service."

436882200001,JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH,Sources of Care for Alcohol and Other Drug Problems: The Role of the African American Church,"African Americans experience significant disparities in treatment access, retention, and quality of care for alcohol and drug use (AOD) problems. Religious congregations, often the first point of contact for help with AOD problems, can play an integral role in improving access to treatment. However, little is known about the role of African American churches in addressing AOD problems. We administered a survey to a faith-based collaborative of 169 African American churches in Los Angeles to examine how AOD problems are identified in congregations, the types of support provided, barriers to providing treatment referrals, and factors associated with the provision of treatment referrals. Seventy-one percent of churches reported caring often for individuals with AOD problems. AOD problems came to the attention of congregations most commonly via a concerned family member (55%) and less frequently through individuals with AOD problems directly approaching clergy (30%). In addition to providing spiritual support, a substantial proportion of churches reported linking individuals to AOD services through referrals (62%) and consultation with providers (48%). Barriers to providing treatment referrals included lack of affordable programs (50%), stigma (50%), lack of effective treatments (45%), and insufficient resources or staff (45%). The likelihood of providing treatment referrals was greater among mid-sized versus smaller-size congregations (OR 3.43; p < .05) and among congregations with clergy that had attended seminary (OR 3.93; p < .05). Knowing how to effectively coordinate informal sources of care provided by African American churches with the formal service sector could make a significant impact on AOD treatment disparities."
428567300008,VIRUSES-BASEL,Oral Immunization against PEDV with Recombinant Lactobacillus casei Expressing Dendritic Cell-Targeting Peptide Fusing COE Protein of PEDV in Piglets,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious disease in newborn piglets. In our previous study, a genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei oral vaccine (pPG-COE-DCpep/L393) expressing a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting peptide fused with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) COE antigen was developed. This vaccine induced significant levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in mice, indicating a potential strategy against PEDV infection. In this study, pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 was used for oral vaccination of newborn piglets against PEDV. We then assessed the immune responses and protection efficacy of pPG-COE-DCpep/L393. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine elicits a specific systemic and mucosal immune response. The T-helper cells mediated by pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and PEDV infection display a Th1 phenotype. The histopathological results showed that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 promotes lymphocyte proliferation and effectively protects piglets against PEDV infection. The transforming growth factor-fi level indicated that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine plays a role in anti-inflammatory responses in mesenteric lymph nodes during PEDV infection. These results show that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 is a potential vaccine against PEDV infection."

It is essential to explore the role of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and interleukin (IL)-18 and their association with disease in patients with severe ACS. Circulating MMP-2 and IL-18 levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 94 subjects with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, n=38), stable angina pectoris (SAP, n=27) and healthy individuals (control group, n=29). We examined the correlations between the levels of MMP-2 and IL-18 and cardiac risk factors in ACS. Logistic regression analysis was performed to screen for factors that predict ACS. Both MMP-2 and IL-18 concentrations were increased in the ACS group compared to the SAP group or control group (P<0.01). Especially, MMP-2 and IL-18 were highly expressed in the patients with ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). Both serum levels of MMP-2 and IL-18 in the single-, double- and triple-vessel lesion group were higher compared to the control group (P<0.01). MMP-2 levels were positively correlated with IL-18 (r=0.639, P<0.01), CK-MB (r=0.47, P=0.003) and hs-CRP levels (r=0.583, P<0.01). The logistic regression analysis showed that increases in MMP-2 levels may be a powerful predictor of ACS. Thus, the changes in levels of serum MMP-2 and IL-18 may be useful in the diagnosis of ACS and prediction of its prognosis."

The heat pipe considered in this study is made of copper-only, and employs an innovative mesh-type wick structure with nanostructured superhydrophilic surface. A single-layered copper woven mesh with nanostructured superhydrophilic surface is used as the liquid wicking structure, whereas a triple-layered coarse mesh with bare copper surface serves for vapor transporation and mechanical support against the high vacuum pressure. The fabricated heat pipe is flexible, suggesting that it can be used in many engineering applications. In addition, an analytic model for predicting the thermal resistance and the maximum heat transfer rate is developed. It has been shown that the nanostructured superhydrophilic surface can bring about a significant enhancement in the thermal performance compared with that with conventional base copper surface. Based on the results from the experiment and the analysis, the effect of wick structure on the thermal performance of the heat pipe is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

To improve the efficiency of intensive care unit (ICU) staff and achieve timely clearance of secretion in patients with mechanical ventilation, we propose a method consisting of feature extraction of sputum sound signals using the wavelet transform and classification of sputum existence using artificial neural network (ANN). Sputum sound signals were decomposed into the frequency subbands using the wavelet transform. A set of features was extracted from the subbands to represent the distribution of wavelet coefficients. An ANN system, trained using the Back Propagation (BP) algorithm, was implemented to recognize the existence of sputum sounds. The maximum precision rate of automatic recognition in texture of signals was as high as 84.53%. This study can be referred to as the optimization of performance and design in the automatic technology for sputum detection using sputum sound signals."
450043000001,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,Pleistocene divergence of two disjunct conifers in the eastern Australian temperate zone,"The eastern Australian temperate biota harbours many plants with fragmented geographic ranges distributed over 1000s of kilometres, yet the spatial genetic structure of their populations remains largely unstudied. In this study, we investigated genetic variation of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast DNA sequences to disentangle the phylogeography of two widely distributed but highly fragmented eastern Australian fire-sensitive temperate conifers: Callitris oblonga (12 populations and 121 individuals) and C. rhomboidea (22 populations and 263 individuals). The three highly disjunct populations of C. oblonga all had unique chloroplast and ITS haplotypes consistent with the classification of these three populations as distinct subspecies. Molecular dating indicates that divergences of these populations occurred pre- to mid-Pleistocene (2.66 to 1.08 mya). Callitris rhomboidea showed greater diversity of chloroplast haplotypes which was strongly phylogeographically structured (Gst = 0.972), with haplotypes unique to specific geographic regions. ITS haplotype diversity was far higher than in C. oblonga with 38 haplotypes displaying high geographic structuring (Gst = 0.387) with many population-specific haplotypes. A phylogeographic break was identified between populations north and south of eastern Victoria dated at 0.43-0.47 mya. In both species, the strong genetic structuring of both chloroplast and ITS haplotypes provides evidence that their widespread ranges have resulted from long term persistence in low fire frequency refugia combined with poor dispersal. Any loss of populations due to increasing fire frequency or habitat loss is likely to result in a reduction of genetic diversity."
443358400008,IMMUNE NETWORK,Viperin Deficiency Promotes Polarization of Macrophages and Secretion of M1 and M2 Cytokines,"Viperin is a multifunctional protein that was first identified in human primary macrophages treated with interferon-gamma. and in human fibroblasts infected with human cytomegalovirus. This protein plays a role as an anti-viral protein and a regulator of cell signaling pathways or cellular metabolism when induced in a variety of cells such as fibroblasts, hepatocytes and immune cells including T cells and dendritic cells. However, the role of viperin in macrophages is unknown. Here, we show that viperin is basally expressed in murine bone marrow cells including monocytes. Its expression is maintained in bone marrow monocyte-derived macrophages (BMDMs) depending on macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) treatment but not on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) treatment. In wild type (WT) and viperin knockout (KO) BMDMs differentiated with M-CSF or G-MCSF, there are little differences at the gene expression levels of M1 and M2 macrophage markers such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase-1, and cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-10, indicating that viperin expression in BMDMs does not affect the basal gene expression of macrophage markers and cytokines. However, when BMDMs are completely polarized, the levels of expression of macrophage markers and secretion of cytokines in viperin KO M1 and M2 macrophages are significantly higher than those in WT M1 and M2 macrophages. The data suggest that viperin plays a role as a regulator in polarization of macrophages and secretion of M1 and M2 cytokines."
430232500016,SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL,Highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence detection of mucin1 based on V2O5 nanospheres as peroxidase mimetics to catalyze H2O2 for signal amplification,"Here, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor was proposed for the detection of mucin1 (MUC1) using V2O5 nanospheres as peroxidase mimics and MUC1-aptamer binding triggered catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) for signal amplification. In this approach, V2O5 nanospheres were capable of immobilizing a large quantity of N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI) functionalized silver nanoparticles (Ag-ABEI) to form the Ag-ABEI@V2O5 signal probe for its large specific surface areas and good stability. Moreover, V2O5 nanospheres not only overcame the intrinsic limitations of natural enzymes, but also could effectively catalyze H2O2 decomposition to generate superoxide anion (O-2(center dot)) for significantly enhancing the ECL intensity of ABEI. To further improve the sensitivity of the proposed aptasensor, the MUC1-aptamer binding triggered CHA was applied to achieve the direct protein recycling without the need of enzyme cleavage and polymerization. The developed approach displayed desirable dynamic range from 10 fg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) and the limit of detection down to 3.33 fg mL(-1). Furthermore, the described approach showed excellent sensitivity for MUC1 detection with the assistance of V2O5 peroxidase mimics and enzyme-free CHA, indicating that the approach would hold potential applications in biological fields.

ESI-FT-ICR MS detected a large range of nitrogen and oxygen compounds in the oils, mostly comprising N-1, O-1, O-2 and N1O1 species. The low mature oils are dominated by O-1 species with double bond equivalent of 4 (DBE = 4; mainly alkylphenols), O-2 species with DBE = 5-6 (i.e., hopanoid, secohopanoic and steroid acids) and DBE = 1 (i.e., fatty acids), indicating a genetic relationship between oxygen compounds and their precursors. The nitrogen and oxygen compounds were significantly influenced by maturity, with the lower maturity oils analyzed enriched in O-2 species, particularly fatty acids and 4-5 ring naphthenes with biologically sourced hydrocarbon skeletons: ratios of O-2/N-1 > 0.7; C20-30/C15-45-DBE1-O-2 > 0.4; and DBE5-6/DBE1(2-22)-O-2 > 6.0 may be useful indicators of low maturity. With increasing maturity, the condensation degree of the compounds increased and the carbon number decreased. The relative abundances of N-1 and O-1 species with the following specific DBE carbon number ranges were particularly sensitive to maturity: DBE9-12/DBE15-18-N-1, C20-28/C29-40-DBE12-N-1, C20-30/C31-50-DBE15-N-1, DBE9-12/DBE4-20-O-1 and C-20-(30)/C31-50-DEE8-O-1. In some instances the FT-ICR MS proxies provided a more reliable indication of high maturity levels than traditional sterane based maturity parameters. However, several of these species were also responsive to other influences, namely C20-28/C29-40-DBE12-N-1 and C20-30/C31-50-DBE15-N-1 ratios reflected an organofacies control and DBE9-12/DBE4-20-O-1 and C20-30/C31-50-DBE8-O-1 ratios changed with thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR)- confirmed by delta S-34 variances of OSCs. In light of the multiple controls on the nitrogen and oxygen compounds, DBE9-12/DBE15-18-N-1 ratio seems unaffected by organofacies or TSR and was considered the most reliable maturity proxy displaying a similar or better maturity relationship than Ts/(Ts + Tm). Aside from secondary alteration effects, the freshwater samples showed several compositional differences to the saline samples, albeit from a limited data set, including generally higher O-2 and N-1 (particularly low MW) product abundances, lower abundances and quite different distribution of O-1 products. These distinctions suggest ESI FT-ICR MS analysis has potential for distinguishing these sample types."
438385400001,JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS,Pump-probe response sensitive to atomic excitation in a hybrid optomechanical system,"We study the pump-probe response in an optomechanical cavity accommodating an ensemble of two-level atoms interacting with a cavity mode, which is pumped by a strong driving field and probed by a weak signal field. The atomic excitation is examined without taking any approximations and may be in any regimes ranging from the low limit to the high limit for a given collective coupling constant between the atomic ensemble and the cavity mode. This then results in different absorption and dispersion spectra (such as optomechanically induced transparency, Fano-resonance, normal-mode splitting) when the excitation transfer from cavity mode to atomic ensemble is controlled to change from ineffective to effective. This indicates that a hybrid optomechanical response is indeed determined by the excitation of the atomic ensemble embedded in the optomechanical cavity. It is also of interest that the output signal component and the inside atomic polarization show either synchronous or asynchronous behaviors depending on how the atom-field detuning is chosen, i.e. equal to the mechanical resonator frequency or its negative. Such features may open up an effective avenue in coherently manipulating the internal atomic polarization via the external signal field, and vice versa."

This method can be evaluated with about 10 mg of carbonized biomass and a VOC of 1 mu L or less, which is an effective evaluation method. The characteristics of carbonized biomass vary depending on the raw material. The VOC adsorption properties also differed depending on the raw materials, and the construction waste charcoal was found to be effective as an adsorbent for aromatic compounds, such as benzene."
439366500001,FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY,Novel Design of Eco-Friendly Super Elastomer Materials With Optimized Hard Segments Micro-Structure: Toward Next-Generation High-Performance Tires,"Recently, sustainable development has become a significant concern globally, and the energy crisis is one of the top priorities. From the perspective of the industrial application of polymeric materials, rubber tires are critically important in our daily lives. However, the energy consumption of tires can reach 6% of the world's total energy consumption per annum. Meanwhile, it is calculated that around 5% of carbon dioxide comes from the emission of tire rolling due to energy consumption. To overcome these severe energy and environmental challenges, designing and developing a high-performance fuel-saving tire is of paramount significance. Herein, a next-generation, eco-friendly super elastomer material based on macromolecular assembly technology has been fabricated. Hydroxyl-terminated solution-polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber (HTSSBR) with high vinyl contents prepared by anionic polymerization is used as flexible soft segments to obtain excellent wet skid resistance. Furthermore, highly symmetrical 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI), different proportions of chain extender, and the cross-linking agent with moderate molecular length are selected as rigid hard segments to achieve simultaneous high heat resistance. Through this approach, a homogeneous network supported by uniformly distributed hard segment nanoparticles is formed because soft segments with equal length are chemically end-linked by the hard segments. This super elastomer material exhibits excellent wear resistance and low rolling resistance. More importantly, the wear resistance, rolling resistance, and wet-skid resistance are reduced by 85.4, 42.3, and 20.8%, respectively, compared to the elastomeric material conventionally used for tire. By taking advantage of this excellent comprehensive service performance, the long-standing challenge of the ""magic triangle"" plaguing the rubber tire industry for almost 100 years is resolved. It is anticipated that this newly designed and fabricated elastomeric material tailored for tires will become the next generation product, which could exhibit high potential for significantly cutting the fuel consumption and reducing the emission of carbon dioxide."
435772200006,CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL,"Quantifying the Sub-Cellular Distributions of Gold Nanospheres Taken Up by Cells through Stepwise, Site-Selective Etching","A quantitative understanding of the sub-cellular distributions of nanospheres taken up by cells is of key importance to the development of effective nanomedicine. With gold nanospheres as a model system, here we demonstrate, for the first time, how to quantify the numbers of nanospheres bound to plasma membrane, accumulated in cytosol, and entrapped in endo-lysosomes, respectively, through stepwise, site-selective etching. Our results indicate that the chance for nanospheres to escape from endo-lysosomes is insensitive to the presence of targeting ligand although ligand-receptor binding has been documented as a critical factor in triggering internalization. Furthermore, the presence of serum proteins is shown to facilitate the binding of nanospheres to plasma membrane lacking the specific receptor. Collectively, these findings confirm the potential of stepwise etching in quantitatively analyzing the sub-cellular distributions of nanospheres taken up by cells in an effort to optimize the therapeutic effect."
435812600001,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE,Activity and Structural Characteristics of Peach Gum Exudates,"Polysaccharide fractions were prepared from peach gum exudates by treatments with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) and liquid hot water (LHW). The structural characteristics and activities of the polysaccharide fractions were comparatively studied. The results suggested that arabinogalactans substituted with xylose and uronic acids were the main structure of all polysaccharide fractions. AHP and LHW treatments introduced the degradation of the polysaccharides, reducing the molecular weight of polysaccharides from 182500 g/mol to 78450 g/mol and 68420 g/mol, respectively. The decreasement of molecular weights responded to the decrease of thermal stability of polysaccharide fractions. However, AHP and LHW treatments removed most of the nonsugar composition, increasing the DPPH center dot- and ABTS(center dot+)-scavenging activity of polysaccharides. Polysaccharide fractions obtained from LHW treatment showed favorable DPPH center dot- and ABTS(center dot+)-scavenging activity at 22.9% and 34.3%, respectively, at concentration of 1000 mu g/mL."
444355500017,PLOS ONE,The vacuolar-type ATPase inhibitor archazolid increases tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells by accumulating extracellular collagen,"The vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (v-ATPase) is the major proton pump that acidifies intracellular compartments of eukaryotic cells. Since the inhibition of v-ATPase resulted in anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects in different tumor models, this enzyme has emerged as promising strategy against cancer. Here, we used the well-established v-ATPase inhibitor archazolid, a natural product first isolated from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra, to study the consequences of v-ATPase inhibition in endothelial cells (ECs), in particular on the interaction between ECs and cancer cells, which has been neglected so far. Human endothelial cells treated with archazolid showed an increased adhesion of tumor cells, whereas the transendothelial migration of tumor cells was reduced. The adhesion process was independent from the EC adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and N-cadherin. Instead, the adhesion was mediated by beta 1-integrins expressed on tumor cells, as blocking of the integrin beta 1 subunit reversed this process. Tumor cells preferentially adhered to the beta 1-integrin ligand collagen and archazolid led to an increase in the amount of collagen on the surface of ECs. The accumulation of collagen was accompanied by a strong decrease of the expression and activity of the protease cathepsin B. Overexpression of cathepsin B in ECs prevented the capability of archazolid to increase the adhesion of tumor cells onto ECs. Our study demonstrates that the inhibition of v-ATPase by archazolid induces a pro-adhesive phenotype in endothelial cells that promotes their interaction with cancer cells, whereas the transmigration of tumor cells was reduced. These findings further support archazolid as a promising anti-metastatic compound."
457816700017,JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"The performance of an in vitro skin sensitisation test, IL-8 Luc assay (OECD442E), and the integrated approach with direct peptide reactive assay (DPRA)","In all current in vitro skin sensitisation assays, DMSO is used to dissolve water-insoluble chemicals. However, our previous study suggested the superiority of the modified IL-8 Luc assay (mIL-8 Luc), in which X-VIVO (TM) 15 is used to dissolve chemicals, over the original assay using DMSO (oIL-8 Luc). In this study, to confirm the superiority of the mIL-8 Luc, we first increased the number of chemicals examined and demonstrated the superiority of the mIL-8 Luc, in which the mIL-8 Luc provided 87.6% of sensitivity, 74.2% of specificity, and 84.6% of accuracy. Next, to clarify the cause of false negative judgment by the mIL-8 Luc, we examined the effects of physical properties of chemicals on judgment. The results demonstrated that high molecular weight, high LogKo/w, or poor water solubility, did not cause false negative judgment. When it was accepted as an OECD test guideline, the criteria of the mIL-8 Luc to determine sensitisers were modified to further decrease false negative judgment by poor solubility. By applying the new criteria, the test guideline IL-8 Luc assay (tgIL-8 Luc) improved sensitivity but decreased specificity and increased the number of chemicals that cannot be judged. To overcome this problem, we examined a simple combination of the tgIL-8 Luc with direct peptide reactive assay (DPRA), which could improve specificity and decrease the number of the chemicals that cannot be judged. These data suggest that the tgIL-8 Luc is a promising in vitro skin sensitisation assay in combination with other in vitro or in chemico methods."
432769900005,MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN,On the photoluminescence of InBO3 and TbBO3 doped by Eu3+ and Ce3+,"This work concerns ortho-borates according to the compositions InBO3:Eu3+, InBO3:Eu3+,Tb3+, and InBO3:Eu3+,Tb3+,Ce3+. All samples were investigated with respect to their structure type and spectroscopic properties. It turned out that InBO3 changes its crystal structure from calcite to high temperature vaterite by the incorporation of Eu3+ or Tb3+. At the same time, novel excitation bands arise caused by optical transitions originating from the presence of Eu3 + or Tb3+. The intensity of the D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+ is enhanced due to the change of the crystal system. Doping Ce3+ into TbBO3:Eu3+ results in a complete change of the absorption spectra caused by the 4f-5d transition of Ce3+. These findings open up the possibility to employ the energy transfer chain Ce3+ -> Tb3+ -> Eu3+. Even though a metal-to-metal CT between Ce3+ and Eu3+ is well known to quench the photoluminescence of Eu3+, we found a quantum yield of about 50%."
428917900012,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS,The disvalue of death in the global burden of disease,"In the Global Burden of Disease study, disease burden is measured as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The paramount assumption of the DALY is that it makes sense to aggregate years lived with disability (YLDs) and years of life lost (YLLs). However, this is not smooth sailing. Whereas morbidity (YLD) is something that happens to an individual, loss of life itself (YLL) occurs when that individual's life has ended. YLLs quantify something that involves no experience and does not take place among living individuals. This casts doubt on whether the YLL is an individual burden at all. If not, then YLDs and YLLs are incommensurable. There are at least three responses to this problem, only one of which is tenable: a counterfactual account of harm. Taking this strategy necessitates a re-examination of how we count YLLs, particularly at the beginning of life."
445914700027,HEART RHYTHM,Assessing the accuracy of an automated atrial fibrillation detection algorithm using smartphone technology: The iREAD Study,"BACKGROUND The Kardia Mobile Cardiac Monitor (KMCM) detects atrial fibrillation (AF) via a handheld cardiac rhythm recorder and AF detection algorithm. The algorithm operates within predefined parameters to provide a ""normal"" or ""possible atrial fibrillation detected"" interpretation; outside of these parameters, an ""unclassified"" rhythm is reported. The system has been increasingly used, but its performance has not been independently tested. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the KMCM system can accurately detect AF. METHODS A single-center, adjudicator-blinded case series of 52 consecutive patients with AF admitted for antiarrhythmic drug initiation were enrolled. Serial 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and nearly simultaneously acquired KMCM recordings were obtained. RESULTS There were 225 nearly simultaneously acquired KMCM and ECG recordings across 52 enrolled patients (mean age 68 years; 67% male). After exclusion of unclassified recordings, the KMCM automated algorithm interpretation had 96.6% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity for AF detection as compared with physician-interpreted ECGs, with a kappa coefficient of 0.89. Physician-interpreted KMCM recordings had 100% sensitivity and 89.2% specificity for AF detection as compared with physician-interpreted ECGs, with a kappa coefficient of 0.85. Sixty-two recordings (27.6%) were unclassified by the KMCM algorithm. In these instances, physician interpretation of KMCM recordings had 100% sensitivity and 79.5% specificity for AF detection as compared with 12-lead ECG interpretation, with a kappa coefficient of 0.71. CONCLUSION The KMCM system provides sensitive and specific AF detection relative to 12-lead ECGs when an automated interpretation is provided. Direct physician review of KMCM recordings can enhance diagnostic yield, especially for unclassified recordings."
432014600004,JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES,Picking the Measuring Stick: The Role of Leaders in Social Comparisons,"Organizational members frequently evaluate how their abilities and standing compare with those of their colleagues. Although these comparisons can have a negative impact on organizations, little attention has been paid to the role of leaders in these processes. Drawing on interviews with individuals in leadership positions in business schools, we develop a framework to explain what triggers leaders' attention to social comparisons among faculty and how they become involved in them. Central to this framework are leaders' self-schemas, which encompass their preferences about the criteria members should use in making comparisons. Leaders' self-schemas are activated by discrepancies between their own comparative judgements and those they perceive members to be making and impel them to act in ways consistent with their preferred bases of comparison. Our framework repositions social comparisons as a multi-perspectival, political phenomenon in which leaders see themselves as playing a role in shaping members' evaluations and workplace interactions."

The problems that have been considered are (i) the lack of data for the solid beta-phase density near the normal melting point and (ii) the formation probability of a triple point on the melting curve for the coexisting beta-, omega-, and liquid phases of titanium. To estimate the change of the volume upon melting 3d elements from Mendeleev's periodic system, a correlation between the change of the volume, Delta V (m) , and the change of the entropy, Delta S (m) , on the melting curve at atmospheric pressure is suggested and effectively used."
433918200009,OPEN CHEMISTRY,Validated thin-layer chromatographic method for alternative and simultaneous determination of two anti-gout agents in their fixed dose combinations,"A rapid, simple and sensitive thin-layer chromatography (TLC) spectrodensitometric method was developed for the simultaneous determination of colchicine and probenecid in their binary mixtures. The two drugs were quantitatively separated using silica gel 60 F-254 as stationary phase and toluene-ethyl acetate-methanol-ammonia (30:20:20:0.1, v/v/v/v) as mobile phase with UV detection at 248 nm for both drugs and at 354 nm for colchicine alone. Both drugs were efficiently separated with R-f values of 0.33 +/- 0.03 and 0.60 +/- 0.03 for probenecid and colchicine, respectively. The linearity was found to be 16-320 and 120-2400 (ng/band) with quantitation limits of 17.59 and 225.82 ng/band for colchicine and probenecid, respectively, at 248 nm. At 354 nm, the linearity range of colchicine was found 16-240 ng/band with a quantitation limit of 54.03 ng/band. The experimental determination ranges were greatly extended with lower quantitation limits (15.60 and 116.13 ng/band for colchicine and probenecid, respectively at 248 nm, and 13.20 for colchicine at 354 nm) and correlation coefficients were improved when polynomial regression analysis was used. The quadratic model was found to be the best fit for all responses. The method has been validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines providing good correlation coefficients (0.9997-0.9999) for both drugs, and it has been successfully applied in the determination of both drugs in their commercial dosage form without interference from excipients."

426493300011,BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING,Manipulation of the sodium-potassium ratio as a lever for controlling cell growth and improving cell specific productivity in perfusion CHO cell cultures,"Perfusion processes typically require removal of a continuous or semi-continuous volume of cell culture in order to maintain a desired target cell density. For fast growing cell lines, the product loss from this stream can be upwards of 35%, significantly reducing the overall process yield. As volume removed is directly proportional to cell growth, the ability to modulate growth during perfusion cell culture production thus becomes crucial. Leveraging existing media components to achieve such control without introducing additional supplements is most desirable because it decreases process complexity and eliminates safety and clearance concerns. Here, the impact of extracellular concentrations of sodium (Na) and potassium (K) on cell growth and productivity is explored. High throughput small-scale models of perfusion revealed Na:K ratios below 1 can significantly suppress cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G0/1 phase. A concomitant increase in cell specific productivity was also observed, reaching as high as 115pg/cell/day for one cell line studied. Multiple recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines demonstrated similar responses to lower Na:K media, indicating the universal applicability of such an approach. Product quality attributes were also assessed and revealed that effects were cell line specific, and can be acceptable or manageable depending on the phase of the drug development. Drastically altering Na and K levels in perfusion media as a lever to impact cell growth and productivity is proposed."

Our design aims to maximize the sum throughput under the transmit power budget, while guaranteeing the coexistence with terrestrial D2D pairs, satisfying the information causality and UAV's trajectory constraints. First, the transmit power planning with a given trajectory is investigated, where a successive convex algorithm is developed by leveraging the D.C. (difference of two convex) programming. Then, we propose a two-step trajectory design method for the given transmit power since the constraints of D2D pairs result in a nonconvex feasible set. Furthermore, an efficient spectrum sharing method for an aerial UAV and terrestrial D2D communications is designed by alternately optimizing the transmit power and UAV's trajectory. Finally, simulation results under various parameter configurations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."
425205400010,WATER RESEARCH,Trace organic contaminant rejection by aquaporin forward osmosis membrane: Transport mechanisms and membrane stability,"We investigated transport mechanisms of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) through aquaporin thin-film composite forward osmosis (FO) membrane, and membrane stability under extreme conditions with respect to TrOC rejections. Morphology and surface chemistry of the aquaporin membrane were characterised to identify the incorporation of aquaporin vesicles into membrane active layer. Pore hindrance model was used to estimate aquaporin membrane pore size as well as to describe TrOC transport. TrOC transport mechanisms were revealed by varying concentration and type of draw solutions. Experimental results showed that mechanism of TrOC transport through aquaporin-embedded FO membrane was dominated by solution-diffusion mechanism. Non-ionic TrOC rejections were molecular weight dependent, suggesting steric hindrance mechanisms. On the other hand, ionic TrOC rejections were less sensitive to molecular size, indicating electrostatic interaction. TrOC transport through aquaporin membrane was also subjected to retarded forward diffusion where reverse draw solute flux could hinder the forward diffusion of feed TrOC solutes, reducing their permeation through the FO membrane. Aquaporin membrane stability was demonstrated by either heat treatment or ethanol solvent challenges. Thermal stability of the aquaporin membrane was manifested as a relatively unchanged TrOC rejection before and after the heat treatment challenge test. By contrast, ethanol solvent challenge resulted in a decrease in TrOC rejection, which was evident by the disappearance of the lipid tail of the aquaporin vesicles from infrared spectrum and a notable decrease in the membrane pore size.

428202900004,BYZANTINISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT,Decoding Byzantine ekphraseis on works of art. Constantine Manasses's description of earth and its audience,"The study deals with ekphraseis on works of art and poses the question as to how far these texts can be a reliable source for the study or even the reconstruction of the artefacts they describe. Based on reception theory and reader-response criticism, in the paper is proposed that as every text, byzantine ekphraseis on artworks presuppose an audience or readership, i.e. the one the author had in mind and on the basis of which he encoded his message. In order to decode this message and by extension to extract any information about the described works of art we must aim to discover their ""intended reader"", and identify his or her ""horizon of expectations. This proposal is tested in the study of a well known piece of this kind, Manasses's description of a mosaic floor with a depiction of Earth. The author's dialogue with the earlier tradition of ekphraseis, his readership's ""horizon of expectations"" combined with historical facts, allow us to suppose that Manasses is describing a composition with Xenia scenes and an asarotos motif (unswept floor) created in the early byzantine period and preserved in the Great Palace of Constantinople up to the twelfth century."

Methods: Fifty patients receiving BBIT were enrolled in this 24-week, prospective, randomized, open-labeled study. After excluding subjects with fasting C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) <1.0 ng/mL and CPR increase <1.0 ng/mL at 6 min post glucagon injection, 25 were randomly allocated to receive Lira-basal (n = 12) or continued BBIT (n = 13). Primary end-point was change in HbAlc. Secondary endpoints were changes in body weight (BW), 7-point self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG), and Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status (DTSQs) scores. Result: The Lira-basal group demonstrated reduced HbAlc, whereas the BBIT group showed no change. BW was reduced in the Lira-basal group but increased in the BBIT group. The Lira-basal group also exhibited significantly reduced pre-breakfast and pre-lunch SMBG. DTSQs scores improved in the Lira-basal group but not the BBIT group. Plasma lipids, liver function, and kidney function were not significantly changed in either group. Conclusions: Lira-basal therapy is superior to BBIT for T2DM without severe insulin deficiency.

Due to improper instrumentation, small workspace and the imperceptibility of body structures, suturing and knot-tying are difficult to perform in both. MethodsAn intracorporeal suture-passing device with two manipulator arms is proposed that automatically passes the suture around ducts of up to 7mm diameter, without additional manipulation of any other surgical instrument, and it can be deployed through a trocar of 3mm inner diameter. ResultsThe working mechanism was validated by 15 trials, where passing the suture around a phantom tube was tested, and the operating time measured as (34.554.55) seconds. ConclusionsSuturing and knotting in SILS and NOTES are currently challenging techniques, but the proposed device enables the suture to be automatically passed around ducts. It is expected that clinical evaluations of future prototypes will further confirm the efficacy of the device."
441933400007,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES,Crustal and uppermost mantle S-wave velocity below the East European Craton in northern Poland from the inversion of ambient-noise records,"The P-wave velocities (V (p)) within the East European Craton in Poland are well known through several seismic experiments which permitted to build a high-resolution 3D model down to 60 km depth. However, these seismic data do not provide sufficient information about the S-wave velocities (V (s)). For this reason, this paper presents the values of lithospheric V (s) and P-wave-to-S-wave velocity ratios (V (p)/V (s)) calculated from the ambient noise recorded during 2014 at ""13 BB star"" seismic array (13 stations, 78 midpoints) located in northern Poland. The 3D V (p) model in the area of the array consists of six sedimentary layers having total thickness within 3-7 km and V (p) in the range 1.85.3 km/s, a three-layer crystalline crust of total thickness similar to 40 km and V (p) within 6.15-7.15 km/s, and the uppermost mantle, where V (p) is about 8.25 km/s. The V (s) and V (p)/V (s) values are calculated by the inversion of the surface-wave dispersion curves extracted from the noise cross correlation between all the station pairs. Due to the strong velocity differences among the layers, several modes are recognized in the 0.021 Hz frequency band: therefore, multimodal Monte Carlo inversions are applied. The calculated V (s) and V (p)/V (s) values in the sedimentary cover range within 0.992.66 km/s and 1.751.97 as expected. In the upper crust, the V (s) value (3.48 +/- 0.10 km/s) is very low compared to the starting value of 3.75 +/- 0.10 km/s. Consequently, the V (p)/V (s) value is very large (1.81 +/- 0.03). To explain that the calculated values are compared with the ones for other old cratonic areas."

450079400003,JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL PSYCHOLOGY,Always available - the role of perceived advantages and legitimacy,"Purpose Studies have shown that availability for work during non-work hours can impair well-being. However, there are significant inter-individual differences regarding these effects. Referring to the effort-reward-imbalance model and the stress-as-offense-to-self model, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role that perceived advantages as well as the illegitimacy of extended availability plays in explaining the inter-individual differences. Design/methodology/approach A total of 310 participants completed an online questionnaire that measured extended availability, illegitimacy of extended availability, advantages of availability and two strain indicators. The authors conducted regression analyses to analyze the effects of extended availability on strain and the moderating role of perceived illegitimacy and advantages of extended availability. Findings Extended availability and - beyond this effect - perceived illegitimacy of extended availability were positively correlated with strain, whereas perceived advantages showed the opposite effect. Furthermore, perceived advantages had a moderating effect in that high advantages buffered the detrimental effects of extended availability. Research limitations/implications The results are based on cross-sectional data. However, the findings confirm previous research indicating that the detrimental effects of extended availability are dependent on specific boundary conditions. In this study, the authors provided evidence for the moderating effect of perceived advantages regarding extended availability. Practical implications The results provided indications to designing availability in a risk-reducing way by accounting for boundary conditions that may increase or decrease the detrimental effects. Originality/value By focusing on perceived illegitimacy and flexibility advantages as boundary conditions for the effects of extended availability, the study introduces two established concepts into the research on increasingly flexible work-home boundaries."
443618100078,REMOTE SENSING,Ocean Wave Measurement Using Short-Range K-Band Narrow Beam Continuous Wave Radar,"We describe a technique to measure ocean wave period, height and direction. The technique is based on the characteristics of transmission and backscattering of short-range K-band narrow beam continuous wave radar at the sea surface. The short-range K-band radar transmits and receives continuous signals close to the sea surface at a low-grazing angle. By sensing the motions of a dominant facet at the sea surface that strongly scatters signals back and is located directly in front of the radar, the wave orbital velocity can be measured from the Doppler shift of the received radar signal. The period, height and direction of ocean wave are determined from the relationships among wave orbital velocity, ocean wave characteristics and the Doppler shift. Numerical simulations were performed to validate that the dominant facet exists and ocean waves are measured by sensing its motion. Validation experiments were conducted in a wave tank to verify the feasibility of the proposed ocean wave measurement method. The results of simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the short-range K-band narrow beam continuous wave radar for the measurement of ocean waves."
430033200011,SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY,Impact of grain sizes on the quantitative concrete analysis using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy,"In civil engineering concrete is the most used building material for making infrastructures like bridges and parking decks worldwide. It is as a porous and multiphase material made of aggregates with a defined grain size distribution, cement and water as well as different additives and admixtures depending on the application. Different grain sizes are important to ensure the needed density and compressive strength. The resulting porous cement matrix contains a mixture of flour grains (aggregates with a grain size below 125 mu m) and cement particles (particle size approximate to 50 mu m). Harmful species like chlorides may penetrate together with water through the capillary pore space and may trigger different damage processes. The damage assessment of concrete structures in Germany is estimated due to the quantification of harmful elements regarding to the cement content only. In the evaluation of concrete using LIBS a two-dimensional scanning is necessary to consider the heterogeneity caused by the aggregates. Therefore, a LIBS system operating with a low energy NdCr:YAG laser, a pulse energy of 3 mJ, a wavelength of 1064 nm, a pulse width of 1.5 ns and a repetition rate of 100Hz has been used. Different Czerny-Turner spectrometers with CCD detectors in the UV and NIR range have been used for the detection. Large aggregates (macro-heterogeneity) can be excluded from the evaluation, whereas small aggregates in the range of the laser spot size (flour grains) cannot be spatially resolved. In this work the micro heterogeneity caused by flour grains and their impact on the quantification with LIBS will be discussed. To analyze the effect of changing grain sizes and ratios, the ablation behavior has been determined and compared. Samples with defined grain sizes were made and analyzed using LIBS. The grain size distributions were analyzed with laser diffraction (LDA). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
425329000001,COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION,A new Hysteretic Nonlinear Energy Sink (HNES),"The behavior of a new Hysteretic Nonlinear Energy Sink (HNES) coupled to a linear primary oscillator is investigated in shock mitigation. Apart from a small mass and a nonlinear elastic spring of the Duffing oscillator, the HNES is also comprised of a purely hysteretic and a linear elastic spring of potentially negative stiffness, connected in parallel. The Bouc-Wen model is used to describe the force produced by both the purely hysteretic and linear elastic springs. Coupling the primary oscillator with the HNES, three nonlinear equations of motion are derived in terms of the two displacements and the dimensionless hysteretic variable, which are integrated numerically using the analog equation method. The performance of the HNES is examined by quantifying the percentage of the initially induced energy in the primary system that is passively transferred and dissipated by the HNES. Remarkable results are achieved for a wide range of initial input energies. The great performance of the HNES is mostly evidenced when the linear spring stiffness takes on negative values.

A large-scale survey of this disease from September and December 2016 in Taiwan was per. formed including symptom check and molecular identification in honey bees of A. cerana hives and several A. mellifera hives, which were co-cultured with A. cerana. Based on the nucleotide sequences of partial VP1, the phylogenetic analysis with those of the known AcSBV isolates revealed that most of AcSBV isolates from Taiwan were closely relative to SBV-FZ and -JL isolates from China, whereas only one sample (N15-5-1) was in a distinct cluster, which was closely relative to SBV-LN from China too. The AcSBV prevalence was occurring in A. cerana hives in most areas of Taiwan except for those in Hualien and Pingtung Counties in Taiwan. Notably, the AcSBV prevalence rate showed the temporal increase from 47.1% to 69.6% within 4 months. In addition, 37.5% of AcSBV prevalence rate was found in A. mellifera hives. It showed that A. mellifera was also susceptible to AcSBV infection. The present results would provide the information on the epidemiology and for prospective research."
445668900022,JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE,Photon energy (8-250 keV) response of optically stimulated luminescence: Implications for luminescence geochronology,"Understanding the energy response of dosimeters and scintillators for measurements of ionising radiation is an important area in the field of solid state dosimetry. Such an understanding is particularly critical for source calibration and for quantifying effective dose (rates) in wide-energy mixed-radiation fields. While there have been several investigations on characterising the ionising-energy response of artificial dosimeters (e.g. LiF, Al2O3:C, etc.), there exist no studies on natural dosimeters such as quartz and feldspar which are extensively used in luminescence geochronology and retrospective dosimetry. Currently, luminescence geochronology assumes that all beta and gamma irradiations in nature (from the decay of K, the U and Th radioactive chains) are equivalent in terms of luminescence production per unit dose to each other, and to the laboratory Cs-137, Co-60 (gamma) and Sr-90/Y-90 (beta) irradiations used for calibration and/or equivalent dose determination. In this study, we experimentally determine the quartz Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and feldspar Infra-Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL: IRSL at 50 degrees C and post-IR IRSL at 290 degrees C) response to irradiations with photons of in the energy range 8-250 keV. We show that microdosimetric effects lead to a steady, significant decrease in quartz OSL production efficiency for < 80 keV photons. Similar to quartz, the local saturation of the electron traps also leads to a systematic decrease in luminescence efficiency for < 120 keV photons in feldspar; however, this effect competes with an increase in recombination efficiency due an increased number density of hole centres in the vicinity of the trap, thus giving a peak-shaped IRSL efficiency response in the range of 250-8 keV. Our results suggest that dose-rate conversion factors, specific to radiation type and radioisotope, should be used for age calculation, and significant care should be taken for luminescence based calibration of the dose rate of the laboratory irradiation source."

Objective: The aim of this study was to perform one of the first randomized clinical trials in adults with prediabetes and one of the longest trials to test whether RS2 can improve cardiometabolic health. Design: 68 overweight [body mass index (BMI) >= 27 kg/m(2)] adults aged 35-75 y with prediabetes were randomized to consume 45 g/d of high-amylose maize (RS2) or an isocaloric amount of the rapidly digestible starch amylopectin (control) for 12 wk. At baseline and postintervention, ectopic fat depots (visceral adipose tissue, intrahepatic lipids, and intramyocellular lipids) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy, energy metabolism by respiratory chamber, and carbohydrate metabolism by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), an intravenous glucose tolerance test, and a meal tolerance test. Cardiovascular risk factors-serum lipids, blood pressure, heart rate, and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha)-werealso measured. The primary endpoints were insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, ectopic fat, and markers of inflammation. Data were primarily analyzed as treatment effects via a linear mixed model both with and without the addition of covariates. Results: Relative to the control group, RS2 lowered HbA1c by a clinically insignificant 0.1 +/- 0.2% (Delta = -1 +/- 2 mmol/mol; P = 0.05) but did not affect insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, the disposition index, or glucose or insulin areas under the curve relative to baseline (P >= 0.23). RS2 decreased heart rate by 5 +/- 9 beats/min (P = 0.02) and TNF-alpha concentrations by 2.1 +/- 2.7 pg/mL (P = 0.004), relative to the control group. Ectopic fat, energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, and all other cardiovascular risk factors were unaffected (P >= 0.06). Conclusions: 12 wk of supplementationwith resistant starch reduced the inflammatory marker TNF-alpha and heart rate, but it did not significantly improve glycemic control and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, in adults with prediabetes."

431989800001,JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE,Hydrological modelling in the anthroposphere: predicting local runoff in a heavily modified high-alpine catchment,"Hydrological models within inflow forecasting systems for high-alpine hydropower reservoirs can provide valuable information as part of a decision support system for the improvement of hydropower production or flood retention. The information, especially concerning runoff, is however rarely available for the calibration of the hydrological models used. Therefore, a method is presented to derive local runoff from secondary information for the calibration of the model parameters of the rainfallrunoff model COSERO. Changes in water levels in reservoirs, reservoir outflows, discharge measurements at water intakes and in transport lines are thereby used to derive the local, ""natural"" flow for a given sub-catchment. The proposed method is applied within a research study for the A-BB Infrastructure Railsystem division in the Stubache catchment in the central Austrian Alps. Here, the A-BB operates the hydropower scheme ""Kraftwerksgruppe Stubachtal"", which consists of 7 reservoirs and 4 hydropower stations. The hydrological model has been set up considering this human influences and the high natural heterogeneity in topography and land cover, including glaciers. Overall, the hydrological model performs mostly well for the catchment with highest NSE values of 0.78 for the calibration and 0.79 for the validation period, also considering the use of homogeneous parameter fields and the uncertainty of the derived local discharge values. The derived runoff data proved to be useful information for the model calibration. Further analysis, examining the water balance and its components as well as snow cover, showed satisfactory simulation results. In conclusion, a unique runoff dataset for a small scale high-alpine catchment has been created to establish a hydrological flow prediction model which in a further step can be used for improved and sustainable hydropower management."
424053600026,APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS,Spatially dependent carrier dynamics in single InGaN/GaN core-shell microrod by time-resolved cathodoluminescence,"The optical properties of InGaN/GaN core-shell microrods are studied by time-resolved cathodoluminescence. Probing the carrier dynamics along the length of the rod from 4 to 300K enables us to decompose radiative (tau(r)) and non-radiative (tau(nr)) lifetimes. At 300 K, tau(nr) decreases from 500 at the bottom of the rod to 150 ps at its top. This variation results from an increased In-content in the upper part of the rod that causes a higher density of point defects. We further observe that thanks to the use of nonpolar m-plane growth, tau(r) remains below 1.5 ns up to room temperature even with a thick active layer, which is promising for pushing the onset of the efficiency droop to higher current densities.

Galectin-3 is a P-galactoside-binding lectin that has been associated with cardiac fibrosis and inflammation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between serum galectin-3 levels and the criteria for 5-year sudden death risk, recently defined in the European Society of Cardiology guidelines (2014), in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Materials and Methods: A total of 52 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were enrolled in the study. Patients were questioned for sudden death risk predictors as outlined in the 2014 European Society of Cardiology guideline. A standardized clinical evaluation was carried out on the basis of previously described prognostic variables to calculate the 5-year risk of SCD. Blood samples were taken from all patients to measure serum galectin-3 levels. A statistical significance level of P < 0.05 was accepted in all tests. Results: We found that there was a significant correlation between the estimated 5-year risk of SCD and serum levels of galectin-3. Conclusions: Galectin-3 may be an inexpensive and easily accessible parameter to predict arrhythmia risk. In addition, it can be used to determine antiarrhythmic prophylaxis as a predictor of an arrhythmia storm in implantable cardioverter defibrillator implanted patients who are not available for magnetic resonance imaging."

435423100007,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS,A Pilot Study of the KIBO Robot in Children with Severe ASD,"This pilot study explores the feasibility of using the KIBO Robot as an engaging platform to positively impact social and emotional development in children with ASD. KIBO is a programmable toy robot originally designed to teach coding and sequencing to neuro-typical children between 4 and 7 years of age. To assess its use in children with severe ASD, twelve participants were introduced to KIBO and engaged in a variety of activities with the robot over four consecutive days. Their interactions were observed on site by raters and simultaneously videotaped for later analysis. We performed a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis in two subjects who completed six or more of the eight planned KIBO play sessions. We observed that most of the participants showed sustained interest in the KIBO robot and increased the frequency of their interactions with adults across play sessions. Although the participants demonstrated only a limited understanding of programming principles during the study, they managed to manipulate the KIBO appropriately, engaged socially with the adults in the room and interacted positively with the robot during individual play. The findings suggest that the KIBO robot warrants further study as an engaging educational platform for children with ASD."
423547900013,EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION,"Association between childhood infection, serum inflammatory markers and intelligence: findings from a population-based prospective birth cohort study","A link between infection, inflammation, neurodevelopment and adult illnesses has been proposed. The objective of this study was to examine the association between infection burden during childhood - a critical period of development for the immune and nervous systems - and subsequent systemic inflammatory markers and general intelligence. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective birth cohort in England, we examined the association of exposure to infections during childhood, assessed at seven follow-ups between age 1.5 and 7.5 years, with subsequent: (1) serum interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at age 9; (2) intelligence quotient (IQ) at age 8. We also examined the relationship between inflammatory markers and IQ. Very high infection burden (90+ percentile) was associated with higher CRP levels, but this relationship was explained by body mass index (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.50), maternal occupation (adjusted OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.98-1.55) and atopic disorders (adjusted OR 1.24; 95% CI 0.98-1.55). Higher CRP levels were associated with lower IQ; adjusted beta = -0.79 (95% CI -1.31 to -0.27); P = 0.003. There was no strong evidence for an association between infection and IQ. The findings indicate that childhood infections do not have an independent, lasting effect on circulating inflammatory marker levels subsequently in childhood; however, elevated inflammatory markers may be harmful for intellectual development/function."
434779300014,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Optimization of Assembly Pipeline may Improve the Sequence of the Chloroplast Genome in Quercus spinosa,"Obtaining chloroplast (cp)genome sequence is necessary for studying physiological roles in plants. However, it is difficult to use traditional sequencing methods to get cp genome sequences because of the complex procedures of preparing templates. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, massive genome sequences can be produced. Thus, a good pipeline to assemble next generation sequence reads with optimized k-mer length is essential to get whole cp genome sequences. Moreover, adjustment of other parameters is also very important, especially for the assembly of the cp genome. In this study, we developed a pipeline to generate the cp genome for Quercus spinosa. When Quercus rubra was used as a reference, we achieved coverage of 97.75% after optimizing k-mer length as well as other parameters. The efficiency of the pipeline makes it a useful method for cp genome construction in plants. It also provides great perspective on the analysis of cp genome characteristics and evolution."

449338200097,MEDICINE,Adrenal relapse of primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma A case report,"Rationale: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a dismal outcome. Most patients relapse in intracranial sites and <5% of patients relapse in extracranial sites. Here, we present the first case of PCNSL with an adrenal relapse. Patient concerns: A 72-year-old woman, first presented 7 years ago with complaints of headache and dizziness. Diagnoses: Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed the mass within the splenium of the corpus callosum. On histological examination, there was a diffuse growth pattern of neoplastic cells in the brain biopsy. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the neoplastic cells were of B-cell lineage. Interventions: The patient underwent methotrexate-based chemotherapy and whole-brain radiotherapy after the initial diagnosis of primary central nervous system-large B-cell lymphoma (CNS-DLBCL). Outcomes: After 4 years of clinical remission, the patient was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Interestingly, a radiological study following the treatment of endometrial cancer demonstrated a right adrenal mass, which was suspicious for malignancy. Morphologic examination and immunohistochemistry studies confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A fluorescent in situ hybridization panel for lymphoma showed rearrangement of Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) and B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), respectively, suggesting fusion of BCL6/IGH. Immunoglobulin kappa analysis demonstrated a common origin for the brain and adrenal lesions, which led to the final diagnosis of an adrenal relapse of CNS-DLBCL. Lessons: PCNSL is a highly infiltrative neoplasm, particularly at relapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of CNSDLBCL with adrenal relapse. Considering the poor outcome of CNS-DLBCL, molecular genetic studies should be done to identify a common origin for the primary and secondary lesion. ."
428808700022,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM,A Novel Generalized Lipodystrophy-Associated Progeroid Syndrome Due to Recurrent Heterozygous LMNA p.T10I Mutation,"Background: Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene mutations cause a heterogeneous group of progeroid disorders, including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, mandibuloacral dysplasia, and atypical progeroid syndrome (APS). Five of the 31 previously reported patients with APS harbored a recurrent de novo heterozygous LMNA p.T10I mutation. All five had generalized lipodystrophy, as well as similar metabolic and clinical features, suggesting a distinct progeroid syndrome. Methods: We report nine new patients and follow-up of two previously reported patients with the heterozygous LMNA p.T10I mutation and compare their clinical and metabolic features with other patients with APS. Results: Compared with other patients with APS, those with the heterozygous LMNA p.T10I mutation were younger in age but had increased prevalence of generalized lipodystrophy, diabetes mellitus, acanthosis nigricans, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatomegaly, together with higher fasting serum insulin and triglyceride levels and lower serum leptin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Prominent clinical features included mottled skin pigmentation, joint contractures, and cardiomyopathy resulting in cardiac transplants in three patients at ages 13, 33, and 47 years. Seven patients received metreleptin therapy for 0.5 to 16 years with all, except one noncompliant patient, showing marked improvement in metabolic complications. Conclusions: Patients with the heterozygous LMNA p.T10I mutation have distinct clinical features and significantly worse metabolic complications compared with other patients with APS as well as patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. We propose that they be recognized as having generalized lipodystrophy-associated progeroid syndrome. Patients with generalized lipodystrophy-associated progeroid syndrome should undergo careful multisystem assessment at onset and yearly metabolic and cardiac evaluation, as hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and cardiomyopathy are the major contributors to morbidity and mortality."
419015800002,IET BIOMETRICS,Face recognition under spoofing attacks: countermeasures and research directions,"Among tangible threats facing current biometric systems are spoofing attacks. A spoofing attack occurs when a person tries to masquerade as someone else by falsifying data and thereby attempting to gain illegitimate access and advantages. Recently, an increasing attention has been given to this research problem, as can be attested by the growing number of articles and the various competitions that appear in major biometric forums. This study presents a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in face anti-spoofing state-of-the-art, discussing existing methodologies, available benchmarking databases, reported results and, more importantly, the open issues and future research directions. As a case study for illustration, a face anti-spoofing method is described, which employs a colour local binary pattern descriptor to jointly analyse colour and texture available from the luminance and chrominance channels. Two publicly available databases are used for the analysis, and the importance of inter-database evaluation to attest the generalisation capabilities of an anti-spoofing method is discussed."
426610900004,ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,"Migration pathways, speed and mortality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts in a Scottish river and the near-shore coastal marine environment","Long-distance migration of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is known to result in high levels of mortality. For a species experiencing global population decline, it is thus vital to better understand migration behaviour, both in the river and marine stages. Atlantic salmon smolts (n=50) were tracked using acoustic telemetry in the River Deveron, Scotland, and adjacent coastal area. Higher rates of mortality were observed in the river (0.77% per km) than the early marine stage of migration (0.0% per km). Mortality likely resulted from predation. Higher swim speeds were recorded in the early marine stage compared with the river (marine=7.37 +/- 28.20km/day; river=5.03 +/- 1.73km/day [mean +/- SD]), a potential predator avoidance behaviour. The majority of smolts leaving the river did so in darkness and on a flooding tide. Overall river and marine migration success were linked to nights of lower lunar brightness. Marine migration speed decreased with increasing environmental noise levels, a finding with implications for fisheries management. The migration pathway in the early marine environment did not follow obvious geographical features, such as the coastline. Thus, we suggest that early marine environment pathways are more influenced by complex water currents. These findings highlight factors that influence smolt migration survival and behaviour, areas on which future research should focus."
453339100006,JOURNAL OF AGING STUDIES,Problematizing the age friendly cities and communities program in Toronto,"This article contributes to the literature on Age Friendly Cities and Communities (AFCC) through a poststructural policy analysis of the program in Toronto. The purpose is to propose an approach, rooted in the study of public policy, that can offer a political interrogation into the problems plaguing AFCCs in practice. The approach centres on a basic question: what problem are AFCCs in Toronto intended to solve? A discourse analysis is undertaken on this problematization, using Toronto's age-friendly policy and 77 qualitative interview transcripts with policy actors as key texts. The findings suggest a dominant discursive practice where AFCCs are used to address the problem of costly seniors rather than the problem of inaccessible environments. However, alternative discursive practices rooted in the rights of senior citizens to access services and amenities in environments are also highlighted through the analysis. AFCC policy is thus flexible enough to be used by different political projects and poststructural policy analysis is useful for teasing out these projects, for understanding the problems that plague AFCCs, as well as for informing rights-based alternatives."
419668400035,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,A new macrofaunal limit in the deep biosphere revealed by extreme burrow depths in ancient sediments,"Macrofauna is known to inhabit the top few 10s cm of marine sediments, with rare burrows up to two metres below the seabed. Here, we provide evidence from deep-water Permian strata for a previously unrecognised habitat up to at least 8 metres below the sediment-water interface. Infaunal organisms exploited networks of forcibly injected sand below the seabed, forming living traces and reworking sediment. This is the first record that shows sediment injections are responsible for hosting macrofaunal life metres below the contemporaneous seabed. In addition, given the widespread occurrence of thick sandy successions that accumulate in deep-water settings, macrofauna living in the deep biosphere are likely much more prevalent than considered previously. These findings should influence future sampling strategies to better constrain the depth range of infaunal animals living in modern deep-sea sands. One Sentence Summary: The living depth of infaunal macrofauna is shown to reach at least 8 metres in new habitats associated with sand injections."
418935300009,ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA,Applying quantitative metabolomics based on chemical isotope labeling LC-MS for detecting potential milk adulterant in human milk,"There is an increasing demand for donor human milk to feed infants for various reasons including that a mother may be unable to provide sufficient amounts of milk for their child or the milk is considered unsafe for the baby. Selling and buying human milk via the Internet has gained popularity. However, there is a risk of human milk sold containing other adulterants such as animal or plant milk. Analytical tools for rapid detection of adulterants in human milk are needed. We report a quantitative metabolomics method for detecting potential milk adulterants (soy, almond, cow, goat and infant formula milk) in human milk. It is based on the use of a high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS platform to profile the metabolome of an unknown milk sample, followed by multivariate or univariate comparison of the resultant metabolomic profile with that of human milk to determine the differences. Using dansylation LC-MS to profile the amine/phenol submetabolome, we could detect an average of 4129 +/- 297 (n = 9) soy metabolites, 3080 +/- 470 (n = 9) almond metabolites, 4256 +/- 136 (n = 18) cow metabolites, 4318 +/- 198 (n = 9) goat metabolites, 4444 +/- 563 (n = 9) infant formula metabolites, and 4020 +/- 375 (n = 30) human metabolites. This high level of coverage allowed us to readily differentiate the six different types of samples. From the analysis of binary mixtures of human milk containing 5, 10, 25, 50 and 75% other type of milk, we demonstrated that this method could be used to detect the presence of as low as 5% adulterant in human milk. We envisage that this method could be applied to detect contaminant or adulterant in other types of food or drinks. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
425355900010,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,Estimation of the Two Degrees-of-Freedom Time-Varying Impedance of the Human Ankle,"An understanding of the time-varying mechanical impedance of the ankle during walking is fundamental in the design of active ankle-foot prostheses and lower extremity rehabilitation devices. This paper describes the estimation of the time-varying mechanical impedance of the human ankle in both dorsiflexion-plantarflexion (DP) and inversion-eversion (IE) during walking in a straight line. The impedance was estimated using a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) vibrating platform and instrumented walkway. The perturbations were applied at eight different axes of rotation combining different amounts of DP and IE rotations of four male subjects. The observed stiffness and damping were low at heel strike, increased during the mid-stance, and decreases at push-off. At heel strike, it was observed that both the damping and stiffness were larger in IE than in DP. The maximum average ankle stiffness was 5.43 N.m/rad/kg at 31% of the stance length (SL) when combining plantarflexion and inversion and the minimum average was 1.14 N.m/rad/kg at 7% of the SL when combining dorsiflexion and eversion. The maximum average ankle damping was 0.080 Nms/rad/kg at 38% of the SL when combining plantarflexion and inversion, and the minimum average was 0.016 Nms/rad/kg at 7% of the SL when combining plantarflexion and eversion. From 23% to 93% of the SL, the largest ankle stiffness and damping occurred during the combination of plantarflexion and inversion or dorsiflexion and eversion. These rotations are the resulting motion of the ankle's subtalar joint, suggesting that the role of this joint and the muscles involved in the ankle rotation are significant in the impedance modulation in both DP and IE during gait."
449475600004,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING,Statistically downscaled projections of CORDEX South Asia using quantile mapping approach over Pakistan region,"Apprehending regional scale climate information from global scale climate models brings uncertainties primarily due to insufficient incorporation of climate information at local scale. We implemented the quantile mapping (QM) approach based on in-situ data that removed the systematic biases in the regional scale simulations of the CORDEX South Asia data for maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation that covers the Pakistani domain. Post processed results were modelled into probability density functions (PDFs) to identify climate change shifts in various statistical moments. The PDF-based analysis for temperature reported negatively skewed patterns in distributions for projections as compared to baseline which forced shifting of percentiles and means towards extreme magnitude regimes. The PDF-based analysis for precipitation displayed lower kurtotic values with fatter and lengthier tails in the projections as compared to baseline which suggested higher frequencies of precipitation extremes to occur in the times to come."
453224600010,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B,Gold nanoparticles impair autophagy flux through shape-dependent endocytosis and lysosomal dysfunction,"The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles have been tuned via various synthetic methods to improve their diagnostic or curative capability. However, systematic understanding of the relationship between their physicochemical properties and biological effects is still not well established. Particularly, the latent ability of nanomaterials to regulate autophagy has already drawn more attention. In this report, by comparing cellular interactions, uptakes, and autophagic effects of gold nanoparticles with different shapes, we reveal that gold nanoparticles could modulate autophagy in a shape-dependent manner. Western blot assays and confocal images confirm that nanospheres cause more autophagosome accumulation than nanorods, which are highly correlated with the difference in cellular uptakes. With biological TEM, we observe remarkable lysosome swelling and clearly identify the engulfed gold nanoparticles together with undegraded organelles in autolysosomes. Additionally, monitoring of the lysosomal activity and p62 degradation indicates an autophagy flux decrease induced by the impairment of lysosomes after treatment with nanoparticles. Our study not only reveals the effects of nanostructure morphology on autophagy, but also provides an alternative strategy to modulate autophagy, which would contribute to the guidelines for further biomedical applications of various nanomaterials."
436583700004,SCANDINAVIAN CARDIOVASCULAR JOURNAL,Correlation of ST changes in leads V4-V6 to area of ischemia by CMR in inferior STEMI,"Objective. We aim to determine the correlation between ST-segment changes in leads V4-V6 and the extent of myocardial injury by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with inferior ST elevation (STE) myocardial infarction (iSTEMI). Design. Admission electrocardiogram and CMR data from the MITOCARE trial were used. Differences in mean myocardium at risk, infarct size, ejection fraction and myocardial segment involvement by CMR were compared in patients with first iSTEMI with STE, ST depression (STD) or no ST changes (NST) in V4-V6. Myocardial segment involvement was further evaluated by comparing proportion of patients in each group with >= 25% and >= 50% segment involvement. Results. Fifty-four patients were included. Patients with STE (n = 22) and STD (n = 16) in V4-V6 had significantly lower ejection fraction compared to NST (n = 16) (48% vs 48% vs 54%, p=.02). STE showed more apical, apical lateral and mid-inferolateral involvement but less basal inferior involvement than NST. STD exhibited greater basal inferoseptal involvement compared to STE. There were more patients with STE that had >= 25% and >= 50% apical lateral involvement compared with STD and NST groups. Patients with STD were more likely to have >= 25% and >= 50% basal inferoseptal involvement compared with STE and NST groups.Conclusion. Our study suggests that in iSTEMI, ST changes in the precordial leads V4-V6 correlates with greater myocardial injury and distribution of myocardium at risk."
424477100008,JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA,Correlation of Concussion Symptom Profile with Head Impact Biomechanics: A Case for Individual-Specific Injury Tolerance,"Concussion is a brain injury induced by biomechanical forces that is broadly defined as a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain. The intricate link between biomechanical input and concussion injury response is poorly understood. We aimed to test the hypothesis that greater biomechanical forces would result in the presentation of more concussion-related symptoms that would take longer to resolve. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between an array of biomechanical parameters measured for concussive impacts and the presentation and resolution of concussion symptoms. A total of 319 collegiate football players from six universities were recruited to participate in this study. Certified athletic trainers and/or team physicians at each site diagnosed and treated concussions sustained by subjects through participation in football. The subjects' helmets were instrumented with accelerometer arrays that measured linear and rotational head accelerations for each impact experienced during games and practices. Correlations between biomechanical measurements associated with concussion symptom presentation and recovery were quantified. A total of 22 subjects collectively sustained 25 concussions, with three subjects sustaining two concussions each. Biomechanical measures associated with injury were not found to be correlated with number of symptoms, Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 Symptom Severity Score, or time to symptom resolution. Linear and rotational accelerations associated with injury were not correlated with symptom severity for any of the 22 individual symptoms evaluated. Further, we found no association between impact location and presence of any individual symptom when ignoring severity grade. While concussive impacts did not stand out relative to impacts that did not result in injury, concussive impacts were among the most severe for each individual player. This suggests tolerance to head acceleration might be individual-specific, meaning similar biomechanical inputs can produce different injury presentations between individuals. Future investigations should consider individual-specific analyses of tolerance to head acceleration and injury response."

Cracking was found to initiate beneath salt particles in the presence of oxidation. The observed transgranular fracture was suspected to be due to hydrogen charging; XRD and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy detected the presence of hydrides that were precipitated on cooling. SEM-EDS showed oxygen enrichment near salt particles, alongside chlorine and sodium. Aluminium and zirconium were also involved in the oxidation reactions. The role of intermediate corrosion products such as Na2TiO3, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiCl2 and TiH are discussed."
446286400106,CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS,Investigating the electrothermal self-healing bituminous composite material using microcapsules containing rejuvenator with graphene/organic hybrid structure shells,"Self-healing bituminous material has become a hot research topic in self-healing materials, and this smart self-healing approach is a promising a revolution in pavement material technology. The aim of this work was to investigate the electrothermal self-healing bituminous composite material using microcapsules containing rejuvenator with grapheneiorganic. The microcapsules owned electric conductivity capability because of the advent of graphene, and realized the self-healing through the two approaches of heat induction and rejuvenation. Microcapsule shells were fabricated using a strength hexamethoxymethylmelamine (HMMM) resin and graphene by a two-step hybrid polymerization. Experimental tests were carried out to character the morphology, integrity and shell structure. It was found that the electric charge balance determined the graphene/HMMM microstructure. The graphene content in shells could not be greatly increased under an electrostatic balance in emulsion. XPS, EDS, TEM and AFM results indicated that the graphene had deposited on shells. TGA/DTG tests implied that the thermal decomposition temperature of microcapsules with graphene had increased to about 350 degrees C. The thermal conductivity of microcapsules had been sharply increased to about 8.0 Wim(2).K with 2.0 wt% graphene in shells. At the same time, electrical resistivity of microcapsules/bitumen samples had a decrease with more graphene in bitumen. The self-healing efficiency of composite samples was evaluated by a beam on elastic foundation (BOEF) mechanical process including loading-unloading reloading cycles under temperature of 0 degrees C. It was found that the samples had an enhanced self-healing capability because of the electrothermal self-healing mechanism. The crack surfaces of bitumen were softened under electrothermal effect. Moreover, the released rejuvenator diffused into aged bitumen with a faster rate under the help of heat energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
424963700061,JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE,Improved photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance of monoclinic bismuth vanadate by surface defect states (Bi1-xVO4),"Due to visible light absorption and photochemical stability, Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), recognized to be a promising photoanodes for designing high efficiency semiconductor photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. To improve the photocatalytic and PEC performance of BiVO4, the porous monoclinic BiVO4 with surface bismuth vacancy (Bi1-xVO4 (s-m)) was obtained after the calcination of tetrahedron bismuth vanadate (BiVO4 (s-t)). The photocatalytic experiments showed that despite the relatively lower adsorption capacity of Bi1-xVO4 (s-m) as compared with BiVO4 (s-t), its photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of tetracyclines (TCs) was 15-fold greater. A four-layer thin films of BiVO4 were deposited by spin coating with intermediate annealing treatment between layers and final calcination at 450 degrees C in air to shed light on carrier transport in Bi1-xVO4 (s-m). The PEC results indicated that BiVO4 (s-t) showed poor charge carrier mobility, while the Bi1-x VO4 (s-m) showed great improvement by transformation of the tetrahedron BiVO4 (s-t) into monoclinic phase, creation of new surface defect states and formation of a porous structure in Bi1-xVO4 (s-m). Furthermore, Bi1-xVO4 (s-m) showed enhanced and stable photocurrent density of 1.2 mA/cm(2) at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl which was achieved under visible light illumination using 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The porous Bi1-xVO4 (s-m) showed the band gap narrowing of 0.08 eV, valence band up-shifting of 0.150 eV and 100 mV cathodic shift in onset potential relative to BiVO4 (s-t). This enhancement is assigned to the longer electron lifetime of Bi1-xVO4 (s-m), 10-fold compared to that of BiVO4 (s-t), resulting in a minimized electron-hole pairs recombination.

432884500050,APPLIED ENERGY,Potential of demand side response aggregation for the stabilization of the grids frequency,"The role of ancillary services related to the frequency control have become increasingly important in the smart grids. Demand Side Response is a competitive resource that can be used to regulate the grid frequency. This paper describes the use of heat pumps and fridges to provide ancillary services of frequency response so that to continuously balance the supply with demand. The power consumption of domestic units is usually small and, therefore, the aggregation of large numbers of small units should be able to provide sufficient capacity for frequency response. In this research, dynamic frequency control was developed to evaluate the capacity that can be gathered from the aggregation of domestic heat pumps and fridges for frequency response. The potential of frequency response was estimated at a particular time during winter and summer days. We also investigated the relationship between both loads (domestic heat pumps and fridges) to provide Firm Frequency Response service. A case study on the simplified Great Britain power system model was developed. Based on this case study, three scenarios of load combination were simulated according to the availability of the load and considering cost savings. It was demonstrated that the aggregation of heat pumps and fridges offered large power capacity and, therefore, an instantaneous frequency response service was achievable. Finally, the economic benefit of using an aggregated load for Firm Frequency Response service was estimated."

This includes, the colchicine concentration (0.01%, 0.025%, 0.05%)/exposure duration ( 1, 3, and 5 h), hypotonic solution (distilled water or 0.075M KCl solution)/exposure duration (30 min, 1, and 2 h), the time of cell suspension preparation (at hypotonic treatment or before slide preparation) and chromosome aging period (0, 3, and 7 days in Carnoy's fixative). In addition, the type (i.e., fin, gill or kidney) and the amount of tissue (10, 50, 100 or 150 mg) were also investigated. Regardless of the species, the result obtained showed that well-spread chromosomes could be obtained using the following optimized protocol: Juveniles are injected with 0.05% colchicine (at one ml kg(-1)) and allowed to swim for 3 h. Then, 50 mg of gill tissue is made into cell suspension in 0.075M KCl for 1 h. The cell suspension is treated in Carnoy's fixative (changed three times at 20 min interval) and then aged for 3 days. Finally, chromosome slides are made and stained with 10% Giemsa for 1 h."
435224800011,NUTRITION METABOLISM AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,Metabolic syndrome associates with left atrial dysfunction,"Background and aims: Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are risk factors of atrial fibrillation (AF), but limited data exist on their effect on left atrial (LA) function. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of cardiac, hepatic and intra-abdominal ectopic fat depots and cardiometabolic risk factors on LA function in non-diabetic male subjects. Methods and results: Myocardial and hepatic triglyceride contents were measured with 1.5T H-1-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and LA and left ventricular function, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), epicardial and pericardial fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 33 men with MetS and 40 men without MetS. LA volumes were assessed using a novel three-chamber orientation based MRI approach. LA ejection fraction (EF) was lower in MetS patients than in the control group (44 +/- 7.7% in MetS vs. 49 +/- 8.6% in controls, p = 0.013) without LA enlargement, indicating LA dysfunction. LA EF correlated negatively with waist circumference, body mass index, SAT, VAT, fasting serum insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index, and positively with fasting serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. VAT was the best predictor of reduced LA EF. Conclusions: MetS associates with subclinical LA dysfunction. Multiple components of MetS are related to LA dysfunction, notably visceral obesity and insulin resistance. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of mechanical atrial remodeling in the development of AF.

454600500009,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,Major QTL controls adaptation to serpentine soils in Mimulus guttatus,"Spatially varying selection is a critical driver of adaptive differentiation. Yet, there are few examples where the fitness effects of naturally segregating variants that contribute to local adaptation have been measured in the field. Plant adaptation to harsh soil habitats provides an ideal study system for investigating the genetic basis of local adaptation. The work presented here identifies a major locus underlying adaptation to serpentine soils in Mimulus guttatus and estimates the strength of selection on this locus in native field sites. Reciprocal transplant and common-garden studies show that serpentine and nonserpentine populations of M. guttatus differ in their ability to survive on serpentine soils. We directly mapped these field survival differences by performing a bulk segregant analysis with F2 survivors from a field transplant study and identify a single QTL where individuals that are homozygous for the nonserpentine allele do not survive on serpentine soils. Genotyping the survivors from an independent mapping population reveals that this same QTL controls serpentine tolerance in a second, geographically distant population. Finally, we show that this QTL controls tolerance to soil properties, as opposed to some other aspect of the field sites that may differ, by performing a laboratory-based common-garden experiment in native serpentine soils that replicates the survival differences observed in the field. These results indicate that despite the myriad chemical and physical challenges plants face in serpentine habitats, adaptation to these soils in M. guttatus has a simple genetic basis."
442502100013,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,Policy Targeting to Reduce Economic Damages From Land Subsidence,"Groundwater pumping contributes significantly to land subsidence, which generates economic costs as changes in the frequency of flooding affect property values. We evaluate these costs by estimating the marginal damages from pumping, which define the corrective policy incentive to address land subsidence externalities. In an application to the southern Chesapeake Bay region of Virginia, we find that land subsidence due to groundwater pumping is greatest in inland rural areas, but that the damages from pumping are greatest in coastal urban areas. Our results suggest that cost-minimizing groundwater policy is spatially heterogeneous and targets the damages from land subsidence due to pumping in different locations, not simply physical land subsidence itself. These results are driven by differences in the spatial patterns of aquifer characteristics, which determine subsidence, and housing density, which determines the damages from subsidence."

Unfortunately, congestion in diffusion path during plating process damages the effects of current collectors. Herein, we developed a 3D Cu skeleton with open micrometer-sized pores by NaCl-assisted powder-sintering method. The unobstructed pores of 3D Cu skeleton help to reduce congestion during plating, thus most of Li deposited inside the current collector. Besides, the large smooth surface promotes the deposition of Li with smooth spherical shape, which mitigating Li dendrite growth. As a result, better safety and rechargeability of Li metal anode were achieved in this design."

However, it is still a great challenge to fabricate high-performance sensors due to the limits of multifunctional sensing platforms. In this work, hierarchical framework-structured PVDF/PU/MWCNT (PPM) aerogels fabricated by a facile thermo-assembly method were suggested as sensitive sensing platform to detect pressure and strain. The pressure-sensing platform based on optimized PPM aerogels exhibited high sensitivity of 62.4 kPa(-1) and fast response of 35 ms, which enabled the detection of minute static pressure of 3 Pa. The sensing platform was also able to detect wide-range compression from 0.5% to 90% and dynamic piezoresistive response behaviour from 1 Hz to 3 kHz, showing excellent repeatability over 50000 compression cycles and ultrahigh strain sensitivity of 156.4, which was the highest reported gauge factor. Moreover, the sensing platform with ultrahigh sensitivity and excellent repeatability enabled the monitoring of human activities, human health, human-machine interactions and non-contact actions such as music intensity. The facile fabrication and versatile capabilities of the sensing platform make it a promising candidate for wearable sensors."

We then apply a mean field method to search for phase transitions in the effective theory at finite densities. The result is a transition line in the plane of temperature and chemical potential, with an end point at high temperature, as expected, but also a second end point at a lower temperature. We cannot rule out the possibilities that a transition line reappears at temperatures lower than the range investigated, or that the second end point is absent for light quarks."

Hermetia illucens was mainly composed of proteins (46.49%, d.m.) followed by fat (37.88%, d.m.). Larvae had a high contamination load of Total Aerobic Mesophilic bacteria (AMB) (1.58x10(7) cfu/g) and Enterobacteriaceae (1.15x10(6) cfu/g). The presence of pathogenic microorganism varied: no Listeria spp. were found, but Salmonella (1.15x10(6) cfu/g) and E. coli (7.08x10(5) cfu/g) were detected in the larvae extract. High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) was effective against natural contaminating yeasts and molds producing more than 5 log cycle reductions at 400 MPa for any of the times considered (2.5 to 7 min), but a low reduction of total microbial load was achieved. The inactivation level of larvae inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 varied. At 400 MPa for 7 min more than 5 log cycle reductions were achieved.

RAW264.7 cells were treated with 0 and 100 mu g/ml nano-TiO2 for 24 h (for miRNA analysis). The differentially expressed miRNAs were detected using Illumina HiSeq (TM) 2000 sequencing. Through the bio-informatics analysis, miR-350 was found to play an important role in multiple signaling pathways, including MAPK signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway and Apoptosis. To characterize the miR-350 function, miR-350 mimic was transfected into RAW264.7 cells for 24 h. MTT and Flow Cytometry were performed to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle (repetition), respectively. QRT-PCR, Western Blot methods and Luciferase assays were applied to detect expression of putative target gene PIK3R3. The results showed that miRNA profiles were differentially dysregulated. The apoptosis rate of miR-350 mimic group was significantly higher than negative control group (p <.05). Cell proliferation and cell cycle had no significant differences between treatment and negative control group. Compared with negative control, the level of protein of PIK3R3 was significantly decreased (p <.05), and the expression of 3'UTR constructs of PIK3R3 was significantly decreased (p <.05) in miR-350 mimic group. The expression of miRNAs was changed after exposed to nano-TiO2, and biological function and target gene results showed miR-350 may promote RAW264.7 cell apoptosis through the negative regulation of PIK3R3 gene. Our results could provide a basis for further understanding of toxicity and possible mechanisms of nano-TiO2 exposure."

Polyembryony is a characteristic that allows to obtaining clonal and zygotic plants in the same seed. In mango this characteristic is presented, however, there is no information that mentions which is the adequate sample size to evaluate it. The objective of the present work was to determine the optimum sample size by means of the maximum curvature method for future polyembryony studies. Mangoes from the cultivar Manila and Ataulfo were collected from the states of Guerrero and Nayarit, Mexico. In each state, two orchards of each cultivar were chosen, and in each one three trees were selected. In the Fruit Biotechnology laboratory of the Colegio de Postgraduados, Campus Montecillo, five fruit variables were evaluated: weight of fruit, seeds (endocarp and embryos), embryos, weight of the largest embryo and number of embryos. In all the variables evaluated, except for the weight of the largest embryo, the inflection point of the curve was in 6 fruits and an optimal sample size of 8 fruits was determined. The minimum variation coefficients (CV) for fruit weight were from 17.9 to 19.1%, for seed weight 12.7 to 19.3%, embryo weight 12.3 to 17.1% and number of embryos 6.7 to 16.7%. In the case of larger embryo weight, it was determined that 20 fruits are the optimal sample size, obtaining CV from 7 to 22.6%. The fruit and seed weight characteristics were the least variation, and number of embryos with higher CV. The cultivar Manila of Nayarit presented the highest CV in all the variables studied."

In this study, we sought to investigate how plasma and myocardial MMP 2 and 9 perform in rabbits with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, searching for a correlation between the activity of these collagenases and cardiac remodeling. Cardiomyopathy was induced by doxorubicin given intravenously twice a week for six consecutive weeks. Plasma MMP activity and the echocardiogram were assessed at baseline, and at 15 and 45 days after first injection of doxorubicin. The myocardial activity of these enzymes was solely evaluated in nine rabbits at 45 days, and results were compared with nine healthy controls. We only identified the full-length forms of both MMP 2 and 9 throughout the study. The plasma pro-MMP 2 reduced along the deterioration of cardiac function, while the pro-MMP 9 increased significantly at T45 as compared to baseline and T15. A negative significant correlation was found to exist between the plasma activity of pro-MMP 2 and mitral E-to-mitral septal annular early diastolic velocity ratio, which is an estimate of mean left atrial pressure and congestion. Only pro-MMP 2 was found in myocardial samples, and mean activity of such enzyme was statistically lower than that recorded for healthy controls. Although no active form was documented for either collagenase, the duration of the treatment with doxorubicin played a role in the alteration of plasma pro-forms activity. However, these changes could not be associated with most echocardiographic parameters that are supportive of cardiac remodeling."

428455100005,NONPROFIT MANAGEMENT & LEADERSHIP,Innovativeness of social economy entities in Poland. An empirical study from the perspective of Positive Organizational Scholarship,"The Polish system of tackling social exclusion is based on social economy entities, such as social integration centers and social cooperatives. The aim of the article is to define the essence and conditions of their innovativeness while answering the question to what extent the organizations can make use of management theories created for business entities. The empirical basis for the article are 3 focus group interviews with representatives of social integration centers and social cooperatives operating in Poland. The results suggest that low innovativeness of the entities is, among others, the effect of an authoritarian management style and a lack of care about positive relationships among employees."
425545600035,SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Plankton community and the relationship with the environment in saline lakes of Onon-Torey plain, Northeastern Mongolia","The plankton community of sixteen saline lakes located on Onon-Torey plain (Northeastern Mongolia) during the filling phase and the raising of the water level was investigated in July 2011. Thirty-five taxa of phytoplankton and thirty-one species of zooplankton were found. For phytoplankton, blue-green algae (Merismopedia elegans, Anabaenopsis elenkinii, Arthrospora fusiformis, Spirulina major, Lyngbya sp., Oscillatoria sp.) and green algae (Monoraphidium minutum, Tetrastrum komarekii, Ankyra ocellata, Oocystis sp.) were dominant. For zooplankton, Filinia longiseta, Brachionus plicatilis, B. variabilis, Hexarthra mira (Rotifera), Daphnia magna, Moina brachiata, M. mongolica (Cladocera), Arctodiaptomus bacillifer, Mixodiaptomus incrassatus, Metadiaptomus asiaticus (Copepoda) dominated. Mineralization, active hydrogen ratio, dissolved oxygen and water temperature were the main factors influencing the diversity, structure and distribution of plankton organisms in the steppe lakes during low water level. The RDA analysis for phytoplankton and zooplankton from different lakes was carried out for selected two groups which included lakes and a subset related species. The first group is of oligohaline and mesohaline lakes in which mostly green algae, rotifers and copepods inhabit. The second group is of mesohaline and polyhaline lakes with mainly blue-green algae, some crustaceans and rotifers inhabiting. High abundance and biomass of Spirulina major, Oscillatoria sp. and Brachionus variabilis were observed in lakes with high mineralization, pH and temperature. (C) 2017 The Authors.

425213900029,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH,Aerosolized deferoxamine administration in mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia improve pulmonary development,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication in preterm newborns. It occurs due to early exposure to high-oxygen and ventilation therapy. The mechanisms of disrupted alveolarization and vascular development associated with BPD were unclear. Deferoxamine (DFO) has been reported to reduce mortality and lung injury in mice after chlorine exposure. The effect of DFO in the treatment of BPD has not been explored. This study aimed to investigate the effect of aerosolized DFO administration in a mouse model of BPD. A mouse model of oxygen-induced BPD was established by postnatal hyperoxia (75% oxygen for 7 days) and DFO [ 17 mg/(kg.day)] (BPD+D) or aerosolized vehicle (BPD+V) administered for 14 days. The mice were anesthetized and sacrificed after 14 days treatment before removing the lungs for analysis. An exogenous continuous aerosol of DFO exerted a biological effect on BPD mice. The BPD+DFO group showed a better weight gain compared with the BPD+V group. Furthermore, the treatment of DFO exhibited a reduced pathological severity and increase expression of hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha and CD31, and activated downstream vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. The results showed that C57BL/6 mice exposed to hyperoxic environment and treated with aerosolized of DFO solution, obviously promoted the pulmonary vascularization and alveolarization. The HIF-1 alpha/VEGF signaling pathway mediated this process. The findings indicated that treatment with an exogenous continuous aerosol of DFO might be a potential therapeutic strategy for BPD."
436194400009,JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,Detection of pea wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp pisi using DNA-based markers,"Identification of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi (Fop), the causal organism of wilt disease of pea, is a time consuming and arduous task. Diagnosis of Fop by traditional means requires more than 2 months and involves two steps, identification of species using morphological characters and formae specialis 'pisi' using pathogenicity assays. The ambiguous morphological differences between F. solani and F. oxysporum further complicate the diagnosis of F. oxysporum. A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) based method was developed to detect Fop from India. A PCR-RFLP marker, HPACAPS1(380), generated after restriction of 28S rDNA region with enzyme MvaI, detected accurately the Fop among several other fungi with detection sensitivity of 5 fg of Fop genomic DNA. In a mixture of Fop and pea DNA, the sensitivity was 500 pg of Fop DNA in 50 ng of pea DNA. The assay was further refined to detect the Fop from infected tissues and infested soil. The current assay can detect Fop from culture, plant tissues and soil in a considerably shorter period of time compared to traditional methods."
426912100008,CROP BREEDING AND APPLIED BIOTECHNOLOGY,Genetic evaluation of Pinus taeda clones from somatic embryogenesis and their genotype x environment interaction,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the genotype x environment interaction and to estimate the genetic components of variance and mean using mixed models in early selection of 238 clones of Pinus taeda propagated by somatic embryogenesis. The experiment consisted of a complete blocks design, with 12 replications, with one plant per plot, in four environments, at 1, 3, and 4 years of age. Estimates of heritability and of genetic gains in the evaluated environments showed good prospects for selection of superior genotypes. The effect of genotype x environment interaction was pronounced for all traits investigated. With the simultaneous selection for stability and adaptability, 10% genetic gain was obtained in relation to the mean of the commercial controls. This estimated gain indicates that the somatic embryogenesis technique has been effective in propagation of clones with good productive potential."
425575200009,COMPUTER NETWORKS,SHMO: A seniors health monitoring system based on energy-free sensing,"The past decades have witnessed the advancement of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) promoting many potential applications in the fields of smart healthcare. Through WSNs, target areas can be monitored and activities of the elderly can be recognized with a large number of deployed sensor nodes. However, previous works suffer from their coarse portability and high susceptibility to environments. In addition, the limited energy supply for sensor nodes emerges as the biggest stumbling block and such a situation is getting worse especially considering the increasing network scale. In this paper, we provide an innovative and energy-efficient system based on energy-free RFID tags to monitor the daily activities and thus determine the physical conditions of the elderly. We achieve the activity recognition by tracking the passive RFID tags attached on the elderly based on the received backscatter signals. In general, we simplify the model of seniors daily life and only consider normal move, slow move, sitting-down and fall as the basic components. DTW and SVM are utilized to discriminate them and then a healthcare assessment system can be achieved. To verify our system, extensive experiments are conducted and experiment results demonstrate that our system achieves a high recognition accuracy of various seniors daily activities and a reliable health assessment can be reached as well.

430468200004,JOURNAL OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY,SERS spectrum of imazalil. Experimental and quantum-chemical vibrational analysis,"Imazalil [1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(2-propenyloxyl-ethyl]-1 H imidazole] is a systemic fungicide that is toxic to a number of plant pathogens, particularly species of Penicillum. Its activity is based on the inhibition of mold sporulation on fruit skin, which makes it one of the most commonly used fungicide in post-harvest citrus treatments for fruit preservation during storage, shipping, and marketing. Due to its wide application, the presence of imazalil needs to be monitored to avoid the excessive and/or improper use. This work reports a complete analysis of the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectra of imazalil as a pure compound as well as in the commercial product for agricultural use; the band assignment relays in the vibrational predictions acquired by quantum-chemical calculations (B3LYP/6-311+g(2df, p)) for the imazalil molecule. An analytical application of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is also presented here. It is done so by using a novel, low-cost, and sensitive SERS-active substrate built with silver nanoparticles supported on a Si/ZnO nanowires platform to detect traces of imazalil in aqueous solutions. Comparison between the Raman and SERS spectra allowed the characterization of the interaction between the pesticide and the silver nanoparticle surface."
429103000003,RISK ANALYSIS,Cyber Risk Management for Critical Infrastructure: A Risk Analysis Model and Three Case Studies,"Managing cyber security in an organization involves allocating the protection budget across a spectrum of possible options. This requires assessing the benefits and the costs of these options. The risk analyses presented here are statistical when relevant data are available, and system-based for high-consequence events that have not happened yet. This article presents, first, a general probabilistic risk analysis framework for cyber security in an organization to be specified. It then describes three examples of forward-looking analyses motivated by recent cyber attacks. The first one is the statistical analysis of an actual database, extended at the upper end of the loss distribution by a Bayesian analysis of possible, high-consequence attack scenarios that may happen in the future. The second is a systems analysis of cyber risks for a smart, connected electric grid, showing that there is an optimal level of connectivity. The third is an analysis of sequential decisions to upgrade the software of an existing cyber security system or to adopt a new one to stay ahead of adversaries trying to find their way in. The results are distributions of losses to cyber attacks, with and without some considered counter-measures in support of risk management decisions based both on past data and anticipated incidents."
427020300006,PHARMACOLOGY,The Effect of Cisplatin on Blood Ammonia Elevation by Alanyl-Glutamine Supplementation,"Background: Although there are many clinical studies in which the beneficial effect of glutamine formulation on mucositis induced by chemo/radiotherapy was evaluated, the results are sometimes conflicting with the report of clinical deterioration. Then, we hypothesized that chemotherapy may increase the incidence of hyperammonemia without comparable change of major parameters of hepatic/renal disorder. Methods: To verify our hypothesis, we examined the increase in blood ammonia level with 1-h intravenous infusion of alanyl-glutamine on day 1-4 after cisplatin (CDDP) administration in rats and assessed the correlation with hepatic/renal parameters. Results: Hepatic parameters (glutamate-oxaloacetic transaminase [GOT] and glutamicpyruvic transaminase [GPT]) with CDDP did not change until day 3 and only GOT increased on day 4. Renal parameters (plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) with CDDP continuously increased up to day 4. Alanyl-glutamine infusion significantly elevated blood ammonia level of CDDP rats with the peak on day 3, although the same dose did not change that of control rats. Conclusion: These results indicates that CDDP enhances the increase in blood ammonia level by glutamine supplementation without correlating with primary parameters for hepatic/renal dysfunction.

429226400005,FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Powdered tucupi condiment: sensory and hygroscopic evaluation,"Tucupi is a fermented liquid obtained from cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), very much appreciated by the traditional cuisine of Northern Brazil. However, there are no scientific reports on its use in the formulation of products. Thus, the present study aimed to elaborate a powdered condiment with tucupi, as well as to assess the product's sensory acceptability and its hygroscopic behavior. The powdered tucupi used in the formulation of the condiment was obtained by drying in a spray dryer. The product underwent sensory evaluation for its acceptability regarding the attributes of color, aroma, flavor, and overall impression and a purchase intention test was applied by hedonic scale. The acceptability index was 80% for overall impression and the purchase intention test indicated that 94% of the judges would be willing to buy the product. The product's moisture sorption isotherms presented type-II behavior for adsorption and type-III for desorption, at 25 degrees C. The hygroscopic behavior indicated that the product is more susceptible to spoilage changes when stored in an environment with relative humidity above 60% and the Peleg model showed an excellent performance on predicting the product's moisture sorption isotherms."
427211200035,SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY,Effect of salt-based adjuvant on partition behaviour of protein in aqueous two-phase systems composed of polypropylene glycol and cholinium glycinate,"Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) composed of ionic liquids (ILs) have been widely explored over the past decade for application in protein purification. The interaction between the phase components of ATPSs and the target protein is one of the factors governing the partition behaviour of the protein, The addition of adjuvants like inorganic salts at a low concentration in an ATPS could manipulate the partitioning of the protein between phases. In this study, the partitioning behaviour of model proteins in ATPSs composed of cholinium glycinate, poly(propylene) glycol 400 and a salt-based adjuvant (i.e., sodium chloride, magnesium chloride and sodium sulfate) was investigated systematically. The dissociated ions with a greater hydration capacity preferentially partitioned to the phase having a higher water content. Also, the partition coefficient of the dissociated ions was independent of the concentration of salt adjuvant. The affinity of adjuvant ions for the IL-rich bottom phase was in the decreasing order of: sulfate ion > chloride ion > magnesium ion > sodium ion. This non-uniform distribution of cations and anions of ionic adjuvants in the ATPS had an influence of the partitioning of proteins in ATPS. Bovine serum albumin and lysozyme, which differ in isoelectric point and surface charge density, were used as the model proteins. The partitioning behaviour of the proteins was affected by the distribution of the dissociated ions of the ionic adjuvant in both phases of the ATPS. The electrostatic interaction between proteins and the dissociated ions of the ionic adjuvant was governed by factors such as types and charge density of the dissociated ions of the salt-based adjuvants, isoelectric point of the protein, and pH of the ATPS. The results proved the feasibility of manipulating the partitioning of target proteins in ATPSs by using inorganic salts as the adjuvant, which provides a means to improve the protein separation in IL-based ATPSs."

Specifically, I examine how my bodily modifications have magnified the social responses to my body as a woman. For example, as a teenager, I acquired a naval piercing and trendy feminine', discretely located tattoos to satisfy a heterosexual male gaze. In contrast, as a woman in my late thirties, my tattoos satisfy a different purpose. They are larger, bolder, and more masculine' in line with the evolution of my feminist politics. However, as an academic, the social responses to my tattoos are more complex. In class defined social spaces such as the university where I work, my tattoos cause trouble because they challenge gendered and classed norms for femininity. I conclude by calling for women to engage in autobiographical writing about bodily modification as a critical feminist political act."
433129800207,BMJ OPEN,Does tranexamic acid lead to changes in MRI measures of brain tissue health in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage? Protocol for a MRI substudy nested within the double-blind randomised controlled TICH-2 trial,"Objectives To test whether administration of the antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH) leads to increased prevalence of diffusion-weighted MRI-defined hyperintense ischaemic lesions (primary hypothesis) or reduced perihaematomal oedema volume, perihaematomal diffusion restriction and residual MRI-defined SICH-related tissue damage (secondary hypotheses). Design MRI substudy nested within the double-blind randomised controlled Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Haemorrhage (TICH)-2 trial (ISRCTN93732214). Setting International multicentre hospital-based study. Participants Eligible adults consented and randomised in the TICH-2 trial who were also able to undergo MRI scanning. To address the primary hypothesis, a sample size of n=280 will allow detection of a 10% relative increase in prevalence of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintense lesions in the TXA group with 5% significance, 80% power and 5% imaging data rejection. Interventions TICH-2 MRI substudy participants will undergo MRI scanning using a standardised protocol at day similar to 5 and day similar to 90 after randomisation. Clinical assessments, randomisation to TXA or placebo and participant follow-up will be performed as per the TICH-2 trial protocol. Conclusion The TICH-2 MRI substudy will test whether TXA increases the incidence of new DWI-defined ischaemic lesions or reduces perihaematomal oedema or final ICH lesion volume in the context of SICH. Ethics and dissemination The TICH-2 trial obtained ethical approval from East Midlands -Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee (12/EM/0369) and an amendment to allow the TICH-2 MRI sub study was approved in April 2015 (amendment number SA02/15). All findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals. The primary outcome results will also be presented at a relevant scientific meeting."
452425200002,SOCIAL INCLUSION,Contemporary Social Theory as a Tool to Understand the Experiences of Disabled Students in Higher Education,"This is a conceptual article which seeks to consider the use of contemporary social theory to help understand the experience of disabled students in higher education. The use of social theoretical insights has been criticised by many as demonstrating a lack of engagement with the everyday experiences of disabled people. Work which strives to embed theoretical insights into the study of disability has also been criticised for lacking engagement with the 'reality' of impairment. In this article I intend to address some of these criticisms by suggesting some ways in which the use of contemporary social theory may provide an explanatory tool which disentangles confusion regarding the journey undertaken by the disabled student. I will discuss how the writings of several social theorists may be helpful in making sense of disabled student journeys. I will begin by discussing why the work of Jacques Derrida can be useful in this regard. These writings will be considered alongside a debate which draws on the writings of Michel Foucault on the use of power in contemporary higher education institutions. I will critically discuss the theoretical insights of Deleuze and Guattari and their offerings on the notion of 'becoming'. I will then critically interrogate the work of Rosi Braidotti and apply these to a re-imagining of the disabled student journey. The writings of these important theorists have been used before to explore the experiences of disabled people. However, this article is unique in that it proposes that these writings can be used to demystify the experiences of disabled students in higher education. I suggest some ways the work of Derrida, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari and Braidotti enable a greater understanding of my personal student journey. I suggest that they could be used to make sense of a far wider range of student journeys. I conclude the article by offering a model which utilises some important aspects of these theoretical insights."
453249800008,TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION,Performance-based visual field testing for drivers with glaucoma: A pilot study,"Objective: Conventional visual field (VF) tests are limited in predicting on-road driving performance of individuals with glaucoma. We developed a new performance-based VF test in a driving simulator for individuals with glaucoma. The aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed test.Methods: In this pilot study, 17 drivers with glaucoma aged 65.249.69 and 13 control drivers aged 61.2711.45 completed the performance-based VF task. Construct validity was determined by comparing performance on the new task with results on conventional visual and perimetry tests including Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer, Keystone Vision Screener, and Useful Field of View (UFOV). Concurrent validity was evaluated by comparing performance on the new task with on-road driving performance, scored using the Test Ride for Investigating Practical fitness-to-drive (TRIP). Ten individuals (7 with glaucoma and 3 controls) participated in the test-retest reliability assessment.Results: Drivers with glaucoma identified fewer symbols (P=.047) and took longer to respond to the symbols (P=.048) compared to controls. In the glaucoma group, correct responses on the performance-based VF test correlated strongly (r=-0.51, P=.046) with UFOV divided attention. Both glaucoma and control groups achieved submaximal to maximal scores on the TRIP (median [Q1-Q3], glaucoma: 193 [191-196]; controls: 196 [195-196]; P=.16). No strong correlations were found between scores on the performance-based VF test and on-road driving performance in glaucoma. The intraclass correlation coefficients ranged between 0.77 for response time and 0.92 for correct responses, indicating good to excellent test-retest reliability.Conclusions: We established the construct validity and test-retest reliability of the performance-based VF test. Future studies should include a larger sample with more severe driving difficulties to demonstrate the concurrent validity between performance-based VF testing and on-road driving performance in glaucoma."
423097800052,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Modeling lethal X-linked genetic disorders in pigs with ensured fertility,"Genetically engineered pigs play an indispensable role in the study of rare monogenic diseases. Pigs harboring a gene responsible for a specific disease can be efficiently generated via somatic cell cloning. The generation of somatic cell-cloned pigs from male cells with mutation(s) in an X chromosomal gene is a reliable and straightforward method for reproducing X-linked genetic diseases (XLGDs) in pigs. However, the severe symptoms of XLGDs are often accompanied by impaired growth and reproductive disorders, which hinder the reproduction of these valuable model animals. Here, we generated unique chimeric boars composed of mutant cells harboring a lethal XLGD and normal cells. The chimeric boars exhibited the cured phenotype with fertility while carrying and transmitting the genotype of the XLGD. This unique reproduction system permits routine production of XLGD model pigs through the male-based breeding, thereby opening an avenue for translational research using disease model pigs."
427249200006,GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH,Deportation and mental health among migrants who inject drugs along the US-Mexico border,"This study describes the prevalence and factors of depressive symptoms among a sample of persons who inject drugs (PWID) with a history of deportation from the US in Tijuana, Mexico. In 2014, 132 deported PWID completed a structured questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CESD-10) screening instrument. Eligible participants were >= 18 years old, injected drugs in the past month, spoke English or Spanish, and resided in Tijuana. Multivariate analyses identified factors associated with depressive symptoms. Among deported PWID, 45% reported current symptoms of depression. Deported PWID who were initially detained in the US for a crime-related reason before being deported (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 5.27; 95% CI: 1.79-15.52) and who perceived needing help with their drug use (AOR: 2.15; 95% 1.01-4.61) had higher odds of reporting depressive symptoms. Our findings highlight the need for effective strategies targeting deported migrants who inject drugs to treat mental health and drug abuse in Tijuana. Investing in the mental health of deported PWID may also be a viable HIV prevention strategy."
433924200013,INFECTION,Management of superficial and deep-seated Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections in sub-Saharan Africa: a post hoc analysis of the StaphNet cohort,"The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is high in sub-Saharan Africa. This is fueled by a high prevalence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which can be associated with necrotizing disease. The aim was to describe the clinical presentation and the treatment of SSTI in the African setting and to identify challenges in the management. Patients (n = 319) were recruited in DR Congo (n = 56, 17.6%), Gabon (n = 89, 27.9%), Mozambique (n = 79, 24.8%) and Tanzania (n = 95, 29.8%) during the prospective observational StaphNet cohort study (2010-2015). A physician recorded the clinical management in standardized questionnaires and stratified the entity of SSTI into superficial (sSSTI) or deep-seated (dSSTI). Selected virulence factors (PVL, beta hemolysin) and multilocus sequence types (MLST) were extracted from whole genome sequencing data. There were 220/319 (69%) sSSTI and 99/319 (31%) dSSTI. Compared to sSSTI, patients with dSSTI were more often hospitalized (13.2 vs. 23.5%, p = 0.03), HIV-positive (7.6 vs. 15.9%, p = 0.11), and required more often incision and drainage (I&D, 45.5 vs. 76.5%, p = 0.04). The proportion of an adequate antimicrobial therapy increased marginally from day 1 (empirical therapy) to day 3 (definite therapy), for sSSTI (70.7 to 72.4%) and dSSTI (55.4 to 58.9%). PVL was a risk factor for I&D (OR = 1.7, p = 0.02) and associated with MLST clonal complex CC121 (OR = 2.7, p < 0.001). Appropriate antimicrobial agents and surgical services to perform I&D were available for the majority of patients. Results from susceptibility testing should be considered more efficiently in the selection of antimicrobial therapy."
431609000006,ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA,Selective Oxidation of Glycerol with Hydrogen Peroxide Using Silica-Encapsulated Heteropolyacid Catalyst,"The Keggin type heteropolyacids (HPAs) have attracted increasing attention due to their strong Bronsted acidity and excellent redox properties, which could play an important role in accelerating the conversion of bio-derived molecules. In this work, heteropolyacid (HPA, H4PMo11VO40) encapsulated by silica was synthesized by a sol-gel method and a sequential silylation technique (HPA@SiO2-N-2-S). The as-synthesized material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The FT-IR spectra show that the HPA anions preserved their Keggin structure when incorporated into the catalyst. The XRD patterns show that HPA molecules are uniformly dispersed within the silica network. The SEM and TEM images confirm that the catalyst was composed of spherical nanometer-sized particles. The porous properties of the catalysts measured by the N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms indicate that the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area of pure SiO2 was 287 m(2).g(-1), but upon encapsulation of HPA into the silica matrix, a lower surface area (245 m(2).g(-1)) was measured for the resulting material. In addition, the pore diameter was reduced after silylation. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the catalysts was investigated by the measurement of contact angle (CA) with water. The SiO2 and SiO2/HPA catalysts were completely hydrophilic and the contact angle was close to 0 degrees. However, the contact angle of the silylated catalyst was determined to be 137 degrees, indicating that the silylation procedure significantly increased the hydrophobicity of the catalyst. The as-prepared catalysts were also used as heterogeneous catalysts for the selective oxidation of glycerol. The prepared material exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards glycerol oxidation, in which the glycerol can be selectively transformed into formic acid (ca. 70% selectivity) and glycolic acid (ca. 27% selectivity) using H2O2 as an oxidant under mild reaction conditions. The effect of the silylation procedure on the recyclability of catalyst was also investigated in this work. The characterizations described above indicated that silylation procedure can significantly increase the hydrophobicity and limit the pore sizes, resulting in high leach-resistance towards HPA, thus improving the recyclability of the silica-encapsulated HPA catalyst, as compared to the SiO2/HPA catalyst prepared with the conventional impregnation method. Furthermore, the conversion in the second catalytic run is even higher than that of the initial run, which is likely because more active sites are exposed after the first run. The catalyst can be reused for at least five cycles without any leaching of HPA. The spent catalyst did not undergo structural changes, as revealed by FT-IR, XRD, and SEM characterization. Moreover, it was found that the strong Bronsted acid additives played a crucial role in the catalytic oxidation of glycerol."
441428700008,IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL,SRSM-Based Adaptive Relay Selection for D2D Communications,"This paper proposes an adaptive relay selection method that exploits the social network and establishes a physical domain and social domain-based model named the Social-based device-to-device (D2D) relay selection model to address relay selection failure caused by the diversity of users cooperation willingness and the instability of communication links due to human mobility. Under the premise of tolerable interference caused to cellular users, the proposed approach synthetically considers the desired physical-relation factor and the social-interaction factor for the relay user. In particular, the reliability of the D2D link is obtained by considering the transmission stability of the link, assessed by the user encounter history and cooperation willingness characterized by user social distance, which is set as the criterion of relay selection, combined with the physical channel condition. Simulation results show that compared with the traditional socially blind method, the proposed method can increase the probability of relay selection success and reduce the burden of the cellular network to improve the system performance."

Treatment data were abstracted from medical records. A CBM score encompassed the number and severity of AHOs, with ordinal logistic regression used to assess associations with exposures. Nonlinear factor analysis and the nonparametric dimensionality evaluation to enumerate contributing traits procedure determined which AHOs co-occurred.ResultsAmong 1,214 participants, approximately 20% had a high (15%) or very high/severe (4.1%) CBM score, whereas approximately 80% scored medium (30%) or low/very low (47%). Increased risks of higher scores were associated with four cycles of either ifosfamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (odds ratio [OR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.71) or bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.98), older attained age (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.26), current disability leave (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.57 to 7.95), less than a college education (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.87), and current or former smoking (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.63). CBM score did not differ after either chemotherapy regimen (P = .36). Asian race (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.72) and vigorous exercise (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.89) were protective. Variable clustering analyses identified six significant AHO clusters (P-2 < .001): hearing loss/damage, tinnitus (OR, 16.3); hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes (OR, 9.8); neuropathy, pain, Raynaud phenomenon (OR, 5.5); cardiovascular and related conditions (OR, 5.0); thyroid disease, erectile dysfunction (OR, 4.2); and depression/anxiety, hypogonadism (OR, 2.8).ConclusionFactors associated with higher CBM may identify testicular cancer survivors in need of closer monitoring. If confirmed, identified AHO clusters could guide the development of survivorship care strategies."
434396100006,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Coupling two spin qubits with a high-impedance resonator,"Fast, high-fidelity single and two-qubit gates are essential to building a viable quantum information processor, but achieving both in the same system has proved challenging for spin qubits. We propose and analyze an approach to perform a long-distance two-qubit controlled phase (CPHASE) gate between two singlet-triplet qubits using an electromagnetic resonator to mediate their interaction. The qubits couple longitudinally to the resonator, and by driving the qubits near the resonator's frequency, they can be made to acquire a state-dependent geometric phase that leads to a CPHASE gate independent of the initial state of the resonator. Using high impedance resonators enables gate times of order 10 ns while maintaining long coherence times. Simulations show average gate fidelities of over 96% using currently achievable experimental parameters and over 99% using state-of-the-art resonator technology. After optimizing the gate fidelity in terms of parameters tuneable in situ, we find it takes a simple power-law form in terms of the resonator's impedance and quality and the qubits' noise bath."
432356100036,JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Estimation of load torque in induction motors via dynamic sliding mode control and new nonlinear state observer,"This study conducts load torque estimation in an induction motor (IM) with uncertainty using a dynamic sliding mode controller (DSMC) that suppresses chattering using an integrator or a low-pass filter placed before the control signal of the system. Hence, the dimension of the augmented system in DSMC is larger than the dimension of the original system, thus leading to an increase in the number of system states. These new state variables should be determined to control such a system. To address this problem, a new nonlinear state observer (NSO) is suggested and utilized in this study. The proposed method is independent of the uncertainty bound of the system, but the system output must be accessible. These subjects are important in practical implementations. Lyapunov theory is applied to validate the stability of the proposed DSMC and NSO methods. Then, the boundedness of the closed-loop signals is concluded from the stability of the proposed techniques. The validity of the proposed approach is evaluated using an IM model. By using DSMC and NSO, we can simultaneously control the IM and estimate its load torque. In particular, the external bounded load torque signal is compensated by the input control signal of the motor. Simulation results illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach."
418456400005,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS,Abnormal Optimal Trajectory Planning of Multi-Body Systems in the Presence of Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints,"In optimal control problems, the Hamiltonian function is given by the weighted sum of the integrand of the cost function and the dynamic equation. The coefficient multiplying the integrand of the cost function is either zero or one; and if this coefficient is zero, then the optimal control problem is known as abnormal; otherwise it is normal. This paper provides a characterization of the abnormal optimal control problem for multi-body mechanical systems, subject to external forces and moments, and holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. This study does not only account for first-order necessary conditions, such as Pontryagin's principle, but also for higher-order conditions, which allow the analysis of singular optimal controls."

431524700014,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE,Robust 3D Object Tracking from Monocular Images Using Stable Parts,"We present an algorithm for estimating the pose of a rigid object in real-time under challenging conditions. Our method effectively handles poorly textured objects in cluttered, changing environments, even when their appearance is corrupted by large occlusions, and it relies on grayscale images to handle metallic environments on which depth cameras would fail. As a result, our method is suitable for practical Augmented Reality applications including industrial environments. At the core of our approach is a novel representation for the 3D pose of object parts: We predict the 3D pose of each part in the form of the 2D projections of a few control points. The advantages of this representation is three-fold: We can predict the 3D pose of the object even when only one part is visible; when several parts are visible, we can easily combine them to compute a better pose of the object; the 3D pose we obtain is usually very accurate, even when only few parts are visible. We show how to use this representation in a robust 3D tracking framework. In addition to extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art, we demonstrate our method on a practical Augmented Reality application for maintenance assistance in the ATLAS particle detector at CERN."

Rapid diagnosis could contribute greatly in containing epidemics and thus avoid economic losses. However, the lack of robust isothermal visual method poses difficulty. In this study, a novel isothermal assay for detecting BPIV3 was established. The method includes a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) assay combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). First, the analytical sensitivity and specificity of BPIV3 LFD RT-RPA were tested. The LFD RT-RPA assay has a detection limit of up to 100 copies per reaction in 30 min at 38 degrees C. Then the performance of LFD RT-RPA was evaluated using 95 clinical samples. Compared to qPCR, the LFD RT-RPA assay showed a clinical sensitivity of 94.74%, a clinical specificity of 96.05% and 0.8734 kappa coefficient. These results have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the method to be developed into a point of care protocol for the diagnosis of BPIV3."

A total of 66 species were identified and based on the presence of small Gephyrocapsa, Reticulofenestra minuta, R. minutula, R. haqii, Pseudoemiliania lacunosa and P. ovate, an age of approximate to 3.6 Ma for Palma Sola I and at least for most part of the Palma Sola II equivalent to the standard NN15 Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilica Zone is assigned. The top of the Palma Sola II column does not contain reticulofenestrids. If its absence is stratigraphic, a younger age could be inferred; however, considering also the absence of zonal indicators, is tentatively, at least approximate to 3.6 Ma. On the basis of the abundance of Coccolithus pelagicus s.l., small to medium Reticulofenestra spp., and small Gephyrocapsa and Helicosphaera spp., a paleoenvironment influenced by coastal upwelling is inferred."

That can affect the direction and velocity of the aircrafts. So, it is very necessary to recognize the low-level wind shear in a short time to make the early warning. In this article, we propose a recognition method which uses support vector machine to make the classification of the low-level wind shear images measured by laser detection and ranging. We use the partial scanning images instead the traditional whole scanning ones, so that it can decrease the calculation time and avoid the wind field inversion. The feature exacting methods we use are invariant moments and gray-gradient co-occurrence matrix. They can, respectively, catch 7 features and 15 features of the wind velocity distribution images. At the same time, we use support vector machine that the parameters are optimized by K-fold cross-validation to do the pattern recognition. Moreover, the simulation results of recognition are given."
437424800002,E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT,IMPACT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ON THE ECOLOGY IN THE REGIONS OF LITHUANIA,"All three components of sustainable development (SD) - economic, social and ecological are closely interrelated and have both direct and reverse impacts. To better understand the SD phenomenon and to manage it purposefully, we need to perform two essential tasks: first, a quantitative analysis of the status of the components; and second, a quantitative assessment of their impact on one another. Both economic development and ecological development are complex processes that manifest themselves in many aspects; thus, the quantitative assessment of the condition of these processes is based on multi-criteria methods. The article analyses the impact of economic development of the regions of the state on the ecological development as an essential component thereof. The latter statement represents the purpose of the study. The set of economic development indices is formed based on the possibility to obtain the required statistical information. Only those indices that reflect irreversible resources: water, air and land resources - are included in the system of economic development indices. Following the assessment of the condition of economic development and of the ecological development, the interrelation between the economic development and the ecological development shall be analysed based on correlation and regression analysis. It has been determined that economic development in the regions of Lithuania has a negative impact on the ecological development in those regions (r = 0.82). The components of economic development reflect only 57% of its impact on the ecology; whereas construction (r = 0.71) and industry (r = 0.47) have the biggest negative impact."
422738000022,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,Open Channel Flow Friction Factor: Logarithmic Law,"The friction factor in open channel flow is considered to increase proportionally with wall roughness compared to that of pipe flow because of undulation at the free surface. The undulation is considered to be driven from the bottom and side walls. The increment factor associated with free surface undulation, shape distortion, and meandering is related to the Manning coefficient, and the incremented friction factor is substituted into the friction factor of circular pipe smooth (stretching) turbulent flow so as to yield the friction factor for open channel flow. The new equation for friction factor or mean velocity provides similar results to the Manning equation and the Ganguillet-Kutter (GK) equation for small streams. However, it is found that the Manning equation results in larger values of mean velocity in wide rivers compared with the GK equation and the new logarithmic equation based on the concept termed as ""smooth turbulent,'' which appears inappropriate in describing the turbulent flow mechanism. Smooth turbulent may have to be denoted as ""stretching turbulent'' because of stretching of the velocity profile as the Reynolds number increases. Based on the comparison results with the other two empirical equations, the new logarithmic equation could be suitably adopted in open channel flows."
419789200022,WIRELESS NETWORKS,DCC: secure selective dropping congestion control in hybrid wireless multimedia sensor networks,"Thanks to the availability of miniaturized camera and microphones, nowadays Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) can sense and deliver audio/video signals from a target environment to remote analysis sites. Hence, new opportunity are disclosed for advanced applications in health care, surveillance, military, and traffic monitoring domains, to name a few. But, at the same time, due to the high volume of multimedia streams and the richness of information they bring, WMSNs incur critical issues in terms of congestion control, privacy, and security. These problems can be solved separately by adopting consolidated solutions conceived to address each of them. But one of the pivotal point of optimization in a Wireless Sensor Network is the possibility of exploiting a cross layer design. To bridge this gap, an integrated solution is proposed hereby, namely Secure Selective Dropping Congestion Control , based on end-to-end ciphering, in-network selective data dropping, scalable multimedia encoding, and hierarchical and hybrid network design. Moreover, an open source implementation of has been developed in the Castalia simulator. The main outcomes of the performance evaluation show that is able to meet data security and privacy requirements and to improve the quality of the received images at the sink with respect to state of the art solutions."
450131800001,GEOFLUIDS,Nitrate Origin in the Zagreb Aquifer System,"Nitrates are among the most common groundwater contaminants worldwide, and the same situation is present within the Zagreb aquifer. The Zagreb aquifer presents the only source of potable water for inhabitants of the City of Zagreb and part of Zagreb County. Isotopic composition of water (delta(2) H and delta O-18) and nitrates (delta(15) N and delta O-18 ), groundwater chemistry, and molar ratios, in combination with correlation and multivariate statistical methods, have been used for the estimation of nitrate origin. Nitrate stable isotopes excluded synthetic fertilizer as the main source of nitrate contamination. They showed insignificant influence of denitrification on nitrate concentrations but could not define the main source of nitrate contamination. The usage of molar ratios, especially NO3-/K+, helped to clarify this issue. Waste water has been defined as the main source of nitrate contamination. All results indicate that nitrogen in a large extent enters the aquifer in the form of ammonium ion, which is transformed to nitrates by the process of nitrification."
446016100005,CELLULAR REPROGRAMMING,"The Forkhead Box C1, a Novel Negative Regulator of Osteogenesis, Plays a Crucial Role in Odontogenic Differentiation of Dental Pulp Stem Cells","The forkhead box C1 (Foxc1) protein, a member of the forkhead/winged helix transcription factor family, is required in stem cell developmental processes. Recently, multiple studies have indicated the crucial role of Foxc1 in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, but the precise effects and mechanisms on dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) remain unclear. In this study, we evaluate the role of Foxc1 on the odontogenic differentiation and proliferation of DPSCs. Our results show that Foxc1 decreases time dependently in odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Meanwhile, overexpression of Foxc1 could significantly inhibit the mineralization of DPSCs and the expression of odontogenic-related genes, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), dentin sialophosphoprote (DSPP), and dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP-1). Foxc1 overexpression does not significantly alter the proliferation of DPSCs. In addition, Foxc1 reduces the expression of p-Smad1/5, an important modulator of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/Smad signaling pathway, inhibiting BMP/Smad signaling pathway. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Foxc1 inhibits odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs and odontogenic-related gene expression through the BMP/Smad signaling pathway which may be useful for the dental regeneration and repair."
447025300001,IEEE ACCESS,Modeling and Design Empirical Formulas of Microstrip Ridge Gap Waveguide,"Recently, interest in the microstrip ridge gap waveguide (MRGW) has increased due to the need for a self-packaged and low-loss structures for millimeter-wave applications. The MRGW consists of a grounded textured surface, which is artificially representing a perfect magnetic conductor surface loaded with a thin low dielectric constant substrate with a printed strip. This is topped with another dielectric substrate covered with a conducting plate at the top as a ground plane. Currently, the full-wave and optimization tools are used to design the MRGW structure. Consequently, an efficient modeling and design tool for the MRGW is proposed in this paper via curve fitting. Closed form empirical expressions for the effective dielectric constant, characteristic impedance, and the dispersion effect are provided. The developed expressions are generalized for arbitrarily chosen MRGW parameters. The expressions are verified with the full-wave solution. The results show the potential of the proposed approach in modeling the MRGW structure"

To develop models that estimate pollutant concentrations at fine spatiotemporal scales and provide improved air pollution exposure assessments for health studies inMexico City. Wedeveloped finer spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) models for PM2.5, PM10, O-3, NO2, CO and SO2 using mixed effect models with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). Hourly traffic density was included as a temporal variable besides meteorological and holiday variables. Models of hourly, daily, monthly, 6-monthly and annual averages were developed and evaluated using traditional and novel indices. The developed spatiotemporal LUR models yielded predicted concentrations with good spatial and temporal agreements with measured pollutant levels except for the hourly PM2.5, PM10 and SO2. Most of the LUR models met performance goals based on the standardized indices. LUR models with temporal scales greater than one hour were successfully developed using mixed effect models with LASSO and showed superior model performance compared to earlier LUR models, especially for time scales of a day or longer. The newly developed LUR models will be further refined with ongoing Mexico City air pollution sampling campaigns to improve personal exposure assessments. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V."
433243400013,SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS,Characterising HIV transmission risk among US patients with HIV in care: a cross-sectional study of sexual risk behaviour among individuals with viral load above 1500 copies/mL,"Objectives Viral load and sexual risk behaviour contribute to HIV transmission risk. High HIV viral loads present greater transmission risk than transient viral 'blips' above an undetectable level. This paper therefore characterises sexual risk behaviour among patients with HIV in care with viral loads> 1500 copies/mL and associated demographic characteristics. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at six HIV outpatient clinics in USA. The study sample comprises 1315 patients with HIV with a recent viral load > 1500 copies/mL. This study sample was drawn from a larger sample of individuals with a recent viral load > 1000 copies/mL who completed a computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) regarding sexual risk practices in the last 2 months. The study sample was 32% heterosexual men, 38% men who have sex with men (MSM) and 30% women. Results Ninety per cent of the sample had their viral load assay within 60 days of the CASI. Thirty-seven per cent reported being sexually active (vaginal or anal intercourse) in the last 2 months. Most of the sexually active participants reported always using condoms (56.9%) or limiting condomless sex to seroconcordant partners (serosorting; 29.2% overall and 42.9% among MSM). Among sexually active participants who reported condomless anal or vaginal sex with an at-risk partner (14%), most had viral loads> 10 000 copies/mL (62%). Conclusions A relatively small number of patients with HIV in care with viral loads above 1500 copies/mL reported concurrent sexual transmission risk behaviours. Most of the individuals in this small group had markedly elevated viral loads, increasing the probability of transmission. Directing interventions to patients in care with high viral loads and concurrent risk behaviour could strengthen HIV prevention and reduce HIV infections."

In this study, we examined leaf area (LA), leaf dry weight (LDW), specific leaf area (SLA), root dry weight (RDW), and shoot height (SH) under different irrigation conditions. The 50 mL/9 day irrigation period treatment produced the lowest LA, LDW, RDW, and SH values. In contrast, the drought treatments produced an increase in leaf water saturation deficits (WSD) in the soybean cultivars, Cheongjakong 3 and Taekwangkong. However, leaf water potential and stomatal conductance declined. Photochemical efficiency decreased in the 50 mL/1 day irrigation period treatment, and decrease in growth and development was noted during the 50 mL/9 day drought treatment. The 50 mL/1 day irrigation treatment produced the highest concentrations of total isoflavones in Cheongjakong 3 (2139.2 +/- 55.4 mu g g(-1)), whereas the 50 mL/9 day treatment led to the lowest isoflavone concentrations (870.3 +/- 10.6 mu g g(-1)). The 50 mL/1 day treatment (2297.3 +/- 9.9 mu g g(-1)) and the 50 mL/3 day treatment (2312.4 +/- 123.2 mu g g(-1)) produced the highest total isoflavone contents in Taekwangkong, whereas the water deficit conditions led to the lowest contents of total isoflavones.

Although a number of CPPA schemes have been proposed in the literature, existing approaches generally suffer from limitations such as the security problem of system private keys, high computation requirement during certificate generation and message verification phases. To resolve these issues, in this paper, it presents a provably-secure CPPA scheme for VANETs and demonstrates that the proposed solution provides both security and privacy required in a VANET application.

Due to its nonlinear properties and birefringence co-efficient, the HNLF also functions as a stabilizer for dual-wavelength fiber laser operation. Results from the experiment show that the fluctuated power of the system is less than 0.6 dB when continuously run for 20 min, indicating the system's stability.

The can be used in challenging environments such as firefighting and the military, even without augmenting with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) provides a solution for the accumulated positioning errors produced by the low precision and high noise of the MIMU, however, there are some problems using ZUPT for FIPPS, include fast-initial alignment and unobserved heading misalignment angle, which are addressed in this paper. Our first contribution is proposing a fast-initial alignment algorithm for foot-mounted inertial/magnetometer pedestrian positioning based on the Adaptive Gradient Descent Algorithm (AGDA). Considering the characteristics of gravity and Earth's magnetic field, measured by accelerometers and magnetometers, respectively, when the pedestrian is standing at one place, the AGDA is introduced as the fast-initial alignment. The AGDA is able to estimate the initial attitude and enhance the ability of magnetic disturbance suppression. Our second contribution in this paper is proposing an inertial/magnetometer positioning algorithm based on an adaptive Kalman filter to solve the problem of the unobserved heading misalignment angle. The algorithm utilizes heading misalignment angle as an observation for the Kalman filter and can improve the accuracy of pedestrian position by compensating for magnetic disturbances. In addition, introducing an adaptive parameter in the Kalman filter is able to compensate the varying magnetic disturbance for each ZUPT instant during the walking phase of the pedestrian. The performance of the proposed method is examined by conducting pedestrian test trajectory using MTi-G710 manufacture by XSENS. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method."

To define minimal requirements for initial steps in the transition of compact, closed chromatin to a transcriptionally active, open state, we developed a model in vitro system containing a single, unique, target nucleosome in the center of a 25-nucleosome array and evaluated the accessibility of the linker DNA adjacent to this target nucleosome. We found that condensation of H1-lacking chromatin results in approximate to 60-fold reduction in linker DNA accessibility and that mimics of acetylation within all four core histone tail domains of the target nucleosome synergize to increase accessibility approximate to 3-fold. Notably, stoichiometric binding of histone H1 caused >2 orders of magnitude reduction in accessibility that was marginally diminished by histone acetylation mimics. Remarkably, a nucleosome-free region (NFR) in place of the target nucleosome completely abrogated H1-dependent restriction of linker accessibility in the immediate vicinity of the NFR. Our results suggest that linker DNA is as inaccessible as DNA within the nucleosome core in fully condensed, H1-containing chromatin. They further imply that an unrecognized function of NFRs in gene promoter regions is to locally abrogate the severe restriction of linker DNA accessibility imposed by H1s."

Method: The core practice elements of a conduct problems prevention program originating in the United States were adapted for prevention efforts in Mexico. Three focus groups were conducted in the United States, with Latino parents (n = 24; 2 focus groups) and professionals serving Latino families (n = 9; 1 focus group), to compare and discuss the Mexican-adapted model and the original conduct problems prevention program. Thematic analysis was conducted on the verbatim focus group transcripts in the original language spoken. Results: Participants preferred the Mexican-adapted model. The following key areas were identified for cultural adaptation when delivering a conduct problems prevention program with Latino families: recruitment/enrollment strategies, program delivery format, and program content (i.e., child skills training, parent skills training, child-parent activities, and child-parent support). For both models, strengths, concerns, barriers, and strategies for overcoming concerns and barriers were identified. Conclusions: We summarize recommendations offered by participants to strengthen the effective implementation of a conduct problems prevention model with Latino families in the United States. This project demonstrates the strength in binational collaboration to critically examine cultural adaptations of evidence-based prevention programs that could be useful to diverse communities, families, and youth in other settings."

Yet, empirical studies and anecdotal accounts show that women's right to informed consent and to refusal of treatment are routinely undermined or ignored during childbirth. The primary reasons currently accepted for exempting a procedure from the informed consent requirement are life-threatening or emergency circumstances and protecting the life of a minor or incompetent person. We will show that these do not apply in low-risk childbirth, and, thus, that obtaining informed consent throughout the normal course of labor and delivery is morally required."

Electron transport layer (ETL) is essential to the performance of PSCs due to its ability of transporting electrons and blocking holes. Herein, the effect of different Ti precursors, tetrabutyl titanate (TT) and titanium diisopropoxide bis (acetylacetonate) (TDB), on the properties of derived TiO2 ETL was systematically investigated. It is noted that the change of Ti precursor have significant influence on the surface state and morphology, electron extraction ability and interface recombination resistance, but not on the crystal phases and chemical states of the obtained TiO2 ETLs. Moreover, compared with TiO2 ETL derived from TDB, the one obtained from TT displays the superior photoelectric properties and the PSCs based on this ETL acquire the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.4% with an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.1 V, a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 23.2 mA cm(-2) and a fill factor (FF) of 68%. We believe that some fundamental insight into the impact of Ti precursor was provided in this research, aiming to find the criterion of the qualified ETL and paving the route for fabricating desirable ETL."

Most TPVs stay on the TP, but a small number can move off the TP to the east. TPVs are known to be one of the main precipitation-bearing systems on the TP and moving-off TPVs have been associated with heavy precipitation and flooding downstream of the TP (e.g., in Sichuan province or over the Yangtze River Valley). Identifying and tracking TPVs is difficult because of their comparatively small horizontal extent (400-800 km) and the limited availability of soundings over the TP, which in turn constitutes a challenge for short-term predictions of TPV-related impacts and for the climatological study of TPVs.

Second-order nonlinear optical processes like Optical Parametric Amplification (OPA) have demonstrated the capability of generating light pulses with durations down to few cycles of the carrier wave. The aim of this paper is to introduce the basic concepts for the generation of tunable ultrashort pulses and show their application to ultrafast spectroscopy. We will discuss the principles of parametric amplification and the main criteria for the design of broad-band OPAs; we will also illustrate some of the schemes providing ultrashort pulses in the spectral ranges from the ultraviolet to the infrared, offering a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of the current research activity in this rapidly evolving field. An important requirement for the applications of ultrashort pulses is the capability to measure the amplitude and phase of their electric field; we will discuss a rich ensemble of spectrographic, interferometric or phase-scanning techniques for the temporal characterization of ultrashort pulses. Pump-probe techniques with broadband pulses and more recently two-dimensional spectroscopic techniques allow to follow in great detail complex dynamical processes. The few examples reported in this review just provide a sample of what is already a vast class of ultrafast phenomena, which can be studied nowadays in real time."
433268700061,MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL,Efficient sampling and determination of airborne N-nitrosamines by needle trap device coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,"N-Nitrosamines are strong carcinogens and widely existing in nature and human environment. Airborne Nnitrosamines are found in tobacco, rubber factories and heavily polluted areas with atmospheric particulate matter. In this paper, needle trap device, an extraction trap device with sorbent inside the needle, coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, was applied as an efficient and solvent-free method for the sampling and the determination of four volatile N-nitrosamines (i.e., N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosodi-n-propylarnine, and N-nitrosodi-n-butylamine) in the atmosphere. The extraction and desorption conditions were selected within the study. Good linearity and recovery values were obtained in the range of 50-3000 ng L-1, and limits of detection of the method were within the range of 1.0-10.0 ng L-1 Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied in sampling and analyzing volatile N-nitrosamines in a local smoking room, and the highest concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine detected was 2954 ng L-1 We suppose that the results may be meaningful for those suffering from second-hand smoke.

435360900001,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,Relationships Between Gastrointestinal Parasite Infections and the Fecal Microbiome in Free-Ranging Western Lowland Gorillas,"Relationships between gastrointestinal parasites (GIPs) and the gastrointestinal microbiome (GIM) are widely discussed topics across mammalian species due to their possible impact on the host's health. GIPs may change the environment determining alterations in GIM composition. We evaluated the associations between GIP infections and fecal microbiome composition in two habituated and two unhabituated groups of wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla g. gorilla) from Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic. We examined 43 fecal samples for GIPs and quantified strongylid nematodes. We characterized fecal microbiome composition through 454 pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Entamoeba spp. infections were associated with significant differences in abundances of bacterial taxa that likely play important roles in nutrition and metabolism for the host, besides being characteristic members of the gorilla gut microbiome. We did not observe any relationships between relative abundances of several bacterial taxa and strongylid egg counts. Based on our findings, we suggest that there is a significant relationship between fecal microbiome and Entamoeba infection in wild gorillas. This study contributes to the overall knowledge about factors involved in modulating GIM communities in great apes."
411767300004,MEASUREMENT,Monitoring power transformers oils deterioration using structured laser illumination planar imaging,"Reliable quality assessments of oils in power transformers are important as they provide valuable information regarding the proper functioning of transformers. Thus, an early and accurate diagnostic of power transformers oils can prevent potential failures of transformers. In this paper, an imaging technique known as Structured Laser Illumination Planar Imaging (SLIPI) was used to monitor the extinction coefficient mu(e) in various oil samples. The proposed technique offers the advantage of extracting the light intensity contribution from singly scattered photons and rejecting most of the light intensity from photons that have been scattered many times. This leads to more accurate and reliable measurement of the extinction coefficient mu(e), in optically dense oil samples. The variation of the extinction coefficient was therefore determined as a function of oil aging. The results demonstrate that SLIPI is reliable as a practical measurement method for the diagnosis of power transformer oils and present an attractive solution, alternative to the conventional methods such as Dissolved Decay Products, Interfacial Tension and Turbidity."
432243200001,JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY,An evaluation of in-office flexible fiber-optic biopsies for laryngopharyngeal lesions,"Background: Operative endoscopy and flexible fiber-optic in-office tissue biopsy are common techniques to assess suspicious laryngopharyngeal lesions. Methods: The primary outcome was the delay to the initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes were delay to biopsy, histopathological diagnosis, and assessment at a multidisciplinary oncology clinic. A retrospective analysis was performed to assess the relative delays between these approaches to biopsy of laryngopharyngeal lesions. Results: There were 114 patients in the study cohort; 44 in-office and 70 operative endoscopic biopsies). The mean delay from consultation to biopsy was 17.4 days for the operative endoscopy group and 1.3 days for the in-office group. The mean delay from initial otolaryngology consultation to initiation of treatment was 51.7 days and 44. 6 days for the operative endoscopy and in-office groups, respectively. Conclusion: In-office biopsy reduced the time from initial consultation to biopsy. The temporal gains via in-office biopsy did not translate into faster access to treatment This outcome highlights the opportunity to improve access to treatment for patients with early diagnosis."
444564500004,DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA,The engaged university and the specificity of place: The case of Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University,"This paper suggests that sufficient imagination about the role of the university as a place-based actor, in conjunction with conditions of institutional embeddedness and normative alignment of university-community engagement, are minimum requirements for place-specific engagement. To explore this process of alignment and institutional conditions in practice, this paper explores one university's approach to embedding engagement and its sense of place-making in the context of multiple institutional logics. Findings show how the university has attempted to embed engagement by following a protracted consultative process that enabled engagement to be aligned with and integrated into the core functions of the university. Findings also show that engagement continues to be driven, at least partially, by market logics that favour financial imperatives over those of place-making."
448148500037,RSC ADVANCES,Synthesis and photoluminescence characteristics of high color purity Ba3Y4O9:Eu3+ red-emitting phosphors with excellent thermal stability for warm W-LED application,"Single phase Eu3+-activated Ba3Y4O9 (Ba-3(Y1-xEux)(4)O-9) red-emitting phosphors with different Eu3+ doping concentrations were synthesized by a high temperature solid-state reaction method. The phase purity, crystal structure, photoluminescence properties, internal quantum efficiency, decay lifetimes, and thermal stability were investigated. Upon excitation at 396 nm near-ultraviolet light and 469 nm blue light, the Ba-3(Y1-xEux)(4)O-9 phosphors exhibited a strong red emission at 614 nm due to the D-5(0) F-7(2) transition of Eu3+ ions. The optimal doping concentration of Eu3+ ions in Ba-3(Y1-xEux)(4)O-9 was found to be x = 0.25. Furthermore, the critical distance was calculated to be 12.78 angstrom and the energy transfer mechanism for the concentration quenching effect was determined to be quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. In addition, the Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of Ba-3(Y0.75Eu0.25)(4)O-9 phosphors were measured to be (0.6695, 0.3302) which located at the red region, and significantly, the high color purity was about 97.9%. The as-synthesized phosphors also possessed excellent thermal stability and the activation energy was determined to be 0.29 eV. Therefore, the investigated results indicated that the Ba3Y4O9:Eu3+ phosphor may be a suitable candidate as a red phosphor for white light-emitting diodes under effective excitation at near-ultraviolet and blue light."
442454400001,ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA COMMUNICATIONS,Anti-tau conformational scFv MC1 antibody efficiently reduces pathological tau species in adult JNPL3 mice,"Tau, the main component of the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), is an attractive target for immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. MC1/Alz50 are currently the only antibodies targeting a disease-specific conformational modification of tau. Passive immunization experiments using intra-peritoneal injections have previously shown that MC1 is effective at reducing tau pathology in the forebrain of tau transgenic JNPL3 mice. In order to reach a long-term and sustained brain delivery, and avoid multiple injection protocols, we tested the efficacy of the single-chain variable fragment of MC1 (scFv-MC1) to reduce tau pathology in the same animal model, with focus on brain regional differences. ScFv-MC1 was cloned into an AAV delivery system and was directly injected into the hippocampus of adult JNPL3 mice. Specific promoters were employed to selectively target neurons or astrocytes for scFv-MC1 expression. ScFv-MC1 was able to decrease soluble, oligomeric and insoluble tau species, in our model. The effect was evident in the cortex, hippocampus and hindbrain. The astrocytic machinery appeared more efficient than the neuronal, with significant reduction of pathology in areas distant from the site of injection. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that an anti-tau conformational scFv antibody, delivered directly into the mouse adult brain, is able to reduce pathological tau, providing further insight into the nature of immunotherapy strategies."
433977200047,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,Characterization of the ScAlMgO4 cleaving layer by X-ray crystal truncation rod scattering,ScAlMgO4-easily cleaved in c-plane-forms a natural superlattice structure of a ScO2 layer and two Al0.5Mg0.5O layers stacking along c-axis. ScAlMgO4 is one of the RAMO(4)-type layered multicomponent oxides and a promising lattice-matching substrate material for InGaN and ZnO. Identification of the topmost layer and the surface atomic structure of the cleaved ScAlMgO4 (0001) are investigated by the X-ray crystal truncation rod scattering method. It is confirmed that ScAlMgO4 is cleaved between the two Al0.5Mg0.5O layers. The two parts separated at this inter-layer are inversion symmetric to each other and without surface charge. This prevents parallelplate-capacitor-like electrostatic force during the cleavage. Two different mechanisms are proposed for the two types of cleavage caused by the impact of a wedge and by the in-plane stress due to an overgrown thick GaN film. It is also revealed that about 10%-20% of the topmost O atoms are desorbed during a surface cleaning at 600 degrees C in ultra-high vacuum. Surface observations using reflection high-energy electron diffraction are possible only after the high-temperature cleaning because the electrical conduction caused by the oxygen deficiency prevents the charge-up of the insulating sample.

431934400009,APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING,Stratified laminar flows in a circular pipe: New analytical solutions in terms of elementary functions,"Laminar stratified two-phase flows in circular pipes are studied. Under the assumption that the wall-liquid wettability properties of the phases are identical, new exact analytical solutions in terms of elementary functions are constructed. The solutions satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations exactly in fluids and the boundary conditions on the pipe walls and the interface for the two cases: the pipe is horizontal and the capillarity forces dominate the gravity ones, the pipe is inclined and the volumetric quantities of liquids in the pipe are the same. For the second case, the capillarity and gravity forces can be arbitrary, but if the gravity forces dominate the capillarity ones, the assumption about the equal wall-liquid tensions of the phases can be withdrawn.

441645500006,HNO,Subjective improvement of hearing through cochlear implantation,"During the past few decades various questionnaires have been developed to evaluate quality of life using audiological measures. The Hearing Implant Sound Quality Index (HISQUI) was developed especially for patients with a cochlear implant (CI). The aim of this study was to evaluate subjective hearing improvement after CI surgery and to correlate the results with objective measuring methods such as pure-tone and speech audiometry. Pre- and postoperative data of 57 patients who received a cochlear implant (CIs) were retrospectively analyzed. For evaluation of subjective hearing ability the HISQUI questionnaire consisting of 19 questions was used as reference. Pure-tone audiometry and Freiburger monosyllable word tests were used as objective measurements for hearing. The mean HISQUI score increased on average from 53.0 prior to surgery to 69.0 after surgery. In addition, there were significant improvements in all seven subgroups of the questionnaire divisions. A correlation of r (Sp)aEuro<overline>= 0.53 before surgery and r (Sp)aEuro<overline>= 0.36 after surgery between the HISQUI scores and Freiburg monosyllable word test was recorded. In addition the 4FPTA (four frequency pure tone average) value correlated negatively with r (Sp)aEuro<overline>= -0.48 with the HISQUI total score before surgery. The moderate correlation of both subjective and objective measurement methods underlines the importance of enquiring the patients' subjective perception and satisfaction. Through the combination of subjective statements and measurements of speech comprehension it is possible to obtain a comprehensive picture of the hearing performance of CI recipients."
462458300001,JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW & CRIMINOLOGY,ASSESSING DANGEROUSNESS AMIDST RACIAL STEREOTYPES: AN ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF RACIAL BIAS IN BOND DECISIONS AND IDEAS FOR REFORM,"The problems of mass incarceration in the United States and its burdens on the economic and social well-being of local communities, counties, and states have received increased attention and have spurred conversations on prison and jail reform. More recently, reform efforts have appropriately focused on the bond system and the role of pretrial detention in fueling jail and prison overcrowding. The bond process presents a unique opportunity for reform because defendants at this stage are presumed innocent and, as the Supreme Court has affirmed, these defendants possess fundamental rights to liberty and a presumption towards pretrial release. Yet jurisdictions, such as Cook County, Illinois, overwhelmingly rely on monetary bonds and other restrictive measures to condition or deny a defendant's release, causing many defendants to remain behind bars for months and even years awaiting trial. As recent research reveals, the use of pretrial detention disproportionately affects black defendants who are more likely to receive higher bond amounts and more restrictive conditions than white defendants facing similar charges. Meaningful bond reform, therefore, must address the role of racial bias in contributing to disparate detention outcomes for black defendants. Bond decisions are particularly susceptible to implicit bias because they often require judges to make quick, on-the-spot, complex, and predictive decisions about a defendant's threat to the community and likelihood to reappear in court. These decisions occur when judges have very limited information about the individual defendant, leading to a misguided reliance on racial stereotypes. Effective bond reform should include the increased use of unsecured bonds instead of monetary bail as a more reliable and less restrictive means to ensure the defendant's return to court and community safety. Jurisdictions should also demand more accountability and transparency from bond judges by requiring publicly available data on bond court practices and jail admissions. Reform efforts should further require judges to undergo training on implicit bias and the proper use of risk-assessment instruments to more fairly and accurately evaluate the risks a defendant poses if released to avoid relying on inaccurate racial stereotypes."
445981200086,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,GIS mapping-based impact assessment of groundwater contamination by arsenic and other heavy metal contaminants in the Brahmaputra River valley: A water quality assessment study,"Groundwater aquifers serve as the primary source of potable water for the vast majority of the population in the Brahmaputra River valley. However, these groundwater reserves form a substantial part of a rapidly weathering alluvial drainage resulting in major contamination by Arsenic (As) and associated heavy metals thereby raising key concern on their safety and sustained usage. The current study entails a comprehensive qualitative analysis of the potable groundwater reserves using a combination of geographical information system (GIS) and geochemical approaches to determine the severity of groundwater contamination by As and other heavy metals in a total of twenty administrative districts of Assam, India. Furthermore, the groundwater solute chemistry and water quality status in the 20 districts of the study area, which encompasses the Brahmaputra River valley, was also assessed to evaluate the sustainability of these potable groundwater reserves. The findings show that the groundwater aquifers present in these districts of the Brahmaputra River valley in Assam are severely contaminated with As with the highest concentration at similar to 352.56 ppb being observed in the district of Nagaon. The districts of Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Golaghat, Sonitpur, Nagaon, Morigaon, Darrang, Udalguri, Kamrup, Nalbari, and Baksa also showed the presence of elevated levels of dissolved As which on an average exceeded the WHO permissible limit of 10 parts per billion as well as the Bureau of Indian Standards limit of 50 parts per billion. Moreover, notable contamination by other heavy metals including lead, manganese, iron, and zinc exceeding the WHO and BIS prescribed limits were prominent. Also, the groundwater was found to harbour elevated concentrations of ions such as HCO3-, Ca-2(+) and Mg2+ which impart severe restrictions on to the safety, aesthetics and palatability of these potable water reserves. Furthermore, the dissolved As content was found to exhibit a significant correlation to the elemental contaminants such as iron and manganese suggesting that the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides may serve as the underlying mechanism for the As enrichment of these groundwater reserves. Additionally, the impact assessment study through the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality index (GWQI) of the areas studied showed that the groundwater reserves in the majority of the administrative districts are unfit for human consumption, without the intervention through requisite water treatment and/or sustainable remediation approaches. These findings indicate the need for serious introspection and reconsiderations on the part of the stakeholders for the sustainable use of these groundwater resources for anthropogenic activities.

444583800001,MEN AND MASCULINITIES,Ineffective Masculinity: Intersection of Masculinity and Nationhood in Portraits of Cuban Men from Time and Newsweek 1959-2010,"Advancing literature on Cuban-American relations through an analysis grounded in hegemonic and relational, or subordinate masculinities, this work explores representations of Cuban male leaders in the US media. Using ethnographic content analysis to examine 763 articles on Cuba from 1959 to 2010 in Time and Newsweek, data reveal narratives of ineffective masculinity as articulated through emergent themes and images that portray Cuban men involved in the revolutionary or political process as (a) simultaneously hypermasculine, that is, motivated by anger, violence, or idealism and (b) hypomasculine or displaying inadequacies in either their professional efforts and/or their physical characteristics. The findings supported by ineffective masculinity add to the literature by recognizing that these male leaders are deemed deficient; however, this deficiency does not rely on tropes of femininity. It is through this analysis that one may recognize the ways in which representations of Cuban male leaders may relate but differ from portraits of other nonwhite men. These findings might reasonably pave the way for possible variations in portrayals of ineffective masculinity and hegemonic masculinity where future research may question what role the trope ineffective masculinity may have on the maintenance of racial inequalities and ideologies especially of men of color in international relations with the United States."
426667100001,NEURAL PLASTICITY,Effects of Time-Compressed Speech Training on Multiple Functional and Structural Neural Mechanisms Involving the Left Superior Temporal Gyrus,"Time-compressed speech is an artificial form of rapidly presented speech. Training with time-compressed speech (TCSSL) in a second language leads to adaptation toward TCSSL. Here, we newly investigated the effects of 4 weeks of training with TCSSL on diverse cognitive functions and neural systems using the fractional amplitude of spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) with the left superior temporal gyrus (STG), fractional anisotropy (FA), and regional gray matter volume (rGMV) of young adults by magnetic resonance imaging. There were no significant differences in change of performance of measures of cognitive functions or second language skills after training with TCSSL compared with that of the active control group. However, compared with the active control group, training with TCSSL was associated with increased fALFF, RSFC, and FA and decreased rGMV involving areas in the left STG. These results lacked evidence of a far transfer effect of time-compressed speech training on a wide range of cognitive functions and second language skills in young adults. However, these results demonstrated effects of time-compressed speech training on gray and white matter structures as well as on resting-state intrinsic activity and connectivity involving the left STG, which plays a key role in listening comprehension."

450560000028,DIABETES CARE,Fasiglifam-Induced Liver Injury in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Results of a Randomized Controlled Cardiovascular Outcomes Safety Trial,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cardiovascular (CV) safety of fasiglifam, a first-in-man G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) agonist, in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A phase 3 multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled two-arm trial was intended to randomize 5,000 participants with type 2 diabetes at high CV risk to fasiglifam or placebo. The primary objective of the trial was to rule out an upper noninferiority bound >1.3 for a one-sided 97.5% confidence limit of the hazard ratio (HR) for CV composite events during treatment with fasiglifam compared with placebo. The primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of any component of the major adverse CV event composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for unstable angina. RESULTS The study enrolled 3,207 participants but was terminated because of liver safety concerns. Increased rates of liver enzyme elevation (AST/ALT >= 3-5 x upper limit of normal [ULN]) with fasiglifam were observed. The incidence of ALT or AST >= 3 x ULN with fasiglifam compared with placebo was 2.1% vs. 0.5%, P < 0.001, and the incidence for >= 10 x ULN was 0.31% vs. 0.06%, P < 0.001. A primary CV composite outcome occurred in 40 participants, 2.5% each in the fasiglifam and placebo arms at 12 months (HR 1.05; 95% CI 0.67, 1.63). CONCLUSIONS Development of fasiglifam was terminated due to concerns of drug-induced liver injury. Performance of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated CV outcomes trial supported the termination of the fasiglifam clinical program."

432612800006,HEALTH EDUCATION & BEHAVIOR,Energy Balance-Related Behavior and Anthropometric Measures Among Adolescents Across Three Educational Levels: A Cross-Sectional Study in Dutch Schools,"Energy balance-related behavior on schooldays and beliefs about school-based interventions may differ between students in different educational levels, sexes, and BMI (body mass index) categories. In Zwolle (the Netherlands), 1,084 adolescents (13-15 years) at 9 secondary schools completed a questionnaire. Overweight prevalence (boys 18.1%, girls 19.3%) increased with decreasing educational level, especially in boys. Girls reported healthier behavior than boys regarding daily consumption of fruit (35% vs. 29%), vegetables (58% vs. 48%), 1 snack/candy (36% vs. 26%), 3 glasses of sugared drinks (80% vs. 73%; all p < .05). Unhealthier dietary behaviors were associated with lower educational level, except for eating sugary and savory snacks. Snacks and sugared drinks consumed at school were mostly brought from home (61.6% and 68.5%, respectively). Overweight students reported less frequent consumption of daily breakfast, snacks, and sugared drinks than nonoverweight students. Of all students, 40% spent 1 hour per day cycling to school. Lower educational level students reported less organized sports activities than higher level students, but more outside play and other activities. Overweight was associated with cycling to school (boys) and participating in organized sports (girls). More girls than boys were interested in lessons about healthy nutrition (44.4% vs. 31.7%). To stimulate physical activity, boys suggested more physical education classes (63%), girls advised more variation (47%) and choice (43%). A healthy school canteen (57%) and offering free fruit (67%) were suggested as promising interventions to stimulate healthy behavior. Educational and environmental interventions to tackle unhealthy dietary and physical activity behavior should be developed in collaboration with parents and tailored to educational level and gender."
435019700012,KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE,Intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography (MI-OCT) for the Treatment of Corneal Dystrophies,"Background The surgical treatment of corneal dystrophies develops rapidly as the use of lamellar corneal grafting techniques continue. While penetrating keratoplasty was the gold standard for treating a variety of dystrophies a few years ago, the affected layers of the cornea can, nowadays, be selectively replaced or ablated using laser technology. Of particular importance for these methods is optical coherence tomography, which has recently been integrated into surgical microscopes (MI-OCT). Methods Literature overview from PubMed and Google.scholar.de supplemented with own imaging data. Results The MI-OCT enables the intraoperative real-time monitoring of different ophthalmic surgical procedures, such as deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, Descemets membrane endothelial keratoplasty, as well as minimally-invasive procedures, such as phototherapeutic keratectomy. In addition, it enables an evaluation of the cornea, but also of structures of the anterior chamber, in situations in which the cornea, for example, is clouded by an edema. Conclusion Microscope-integrated, intraoperative optical coherence tomography (MI-OCT) represents a useful supplement to the normal surgical microscope. It is superior to the sole surgical microscope, especially in already severely clouded corneas, and represents a sensible supplement, especially for novel lamellar transplantation procedures. Prospective randomized trials are necessary to increase safety and efficacy when using MI-OCT for different indications."
427792200001,CELLULAR & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LETTERS,GSK-3 beta-mediated regulation of cadmium-induced cell death and survival,"Background: Previous studies indicated that cadmium (Cd) increases PI3-kinase/Akt phosphorylation, resulting in an alteration in GSK-3 beta activity. However, the mechanism of Cd-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in neuronal cells has yet to be studied in needs further elucidation. We examined the role of GSK-3 beta in Cd-induced neuronal cell death and the related downstream signaling pathways. Methods: SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were treated with 10 or 20 mu M BAPTA-AM and 1 mu M wortmannin for 30 min and then incubated with 25 mu M Cd for 12 h. Apoptotic cells were visualized via DAPI and PI staining. Data were evaluated with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student's t-test. Data are expressed as the means +/- SD of experiments performed at least three times. Results: Treatment of human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells with Cd induced ER, stress as evidenced by the increased expression of GRP78, which is a marker of ER stress. Cd exposure significantly increased the phosphorylation of Akt at thr308 and ser473 and that of GSK-3 beta at ser9 in a time-dependent manner, while the total protein levels of GSK-3 beta and Akt did not change. Cd-induced apoptosis was higher in GSK-3 beta-knockdown cells than in normal cells. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Akt/GSK-3 beta signaling activated by Cd is involved in neuronal cell survival."
428849100012,JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE,"Assessment of the reducing capacity of processed fruit juices with the copper(I)/4,4 '-dicarboxy-2,2 '-biquinoline complexes","An alternative method for quantification of the total reducing capacity (TRC) of processed ready-to-drink fruit juices (orange, grape, peach, mango, cashew, strawberry, apple and guava) is suggested. The spectrophotometric procedure is based on the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by antioxidants (present in the samples) in aqueous buffered solution (pH 7.0), containing 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-biquinoline acid (H(2)BCA), yielding the complexes. The absorbance values at 558 nm (A(558 nm)) of the complexes obtained with juice samples were compared with A(558 nm) values of the same complexes obtained with a standard ascorbic acid solution and used to quantify and express the reducing capacity of each sample. Regarding orange juices a positive relationship between the TRC values using the complexes and the labelled ascorbic acid (AA) content along with the total polyphenol content (TPC) was measured. Grape juices showed the best positive correlation was verified between the TRC (with the complexes) and the TPC. While other fruit juices showed good agreement of TRC values with complexes and DPPH reagent. The proposed method may be applied to measure the TRC of beers and wines and also for biological samples like serum and follicular fluid."
427632300010,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,Perseverative Cognition as an Explanatory Mechanism in the Relation Between Job Demands and Sleep Quality,"The aim of this longitudinal three-wave study was to examine (i) reciprocal associations among job demands, work-related perseverative cognition (PC), and sleep quality; (ii) PC as a mediator in-between job demands and sleep quality; and (iii) continuous high job demands in relation to sleep quality and work-related PC over time. A representative sample of the Swedish working population was approached in 2010, 2012, and 2014, and 2316 respondents were included in this longitudinal full-panel survey study. Structural equation modelling was performed to analyse the temporal relations between job demands, work-related PC, and sleep quality. Additionally, a subsample (N = 1149) consisting of individuals who reported the same level of exposure to job demands during all three waves (i.e. stable high, stable moderate, or stable low job demands) was examined in relation to PC and sleep quality over time. Analyses showed that job demands, PC, and poor sleep quality were positively and reciprocally related. Work-related PC mediated the normal and reversed, direct across-wave relations between job demands and sleep quality. Individuals with continuous high job demands reported significantly lower sleep quality and higher work-related PC, compared to individuals with continuous moderate/low job demands. This study substantiated reciprocal relations between job demands, work-related PC, and sleep quality and supported work-related PC as an underlying mechanism of the reciprocal job demands-sleep relationship. Moreover, this study showed that chronically high job demands are a risk factor for low sleep quality."

The main objective of this study was to identify the number of juvenile bipolar disorder diagnoses according to DSM-5 criteria in a population of children and adolescents hospitalized for suicide attempts. Secondary objectives were the assessment of a patient's characteristics and the comparison of suicide attempt recurrence during 12 months of follow-up. Methods. - This current practice study consecutively included children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years and hospitalized for a suicide attempt in a French University Pediatric Hospital over a 4-month period. Patients were assessed at baseline, at 3 months and at 12 months. The standardized assessment was realized by the investigator using semi-structured interview K-SADS-PL (2013) to diagnose juvenile bipolar disorders based on DSM-5 criteria. Clinical diagnoses based on medical charts and according to ICD-10 criteria were also collected at 12-month follow-up. Standardized assessment was completed by the French validated K-SADS-PL (2004) for comorbidities (DSM-IV), dimensional assessment by MADRS-YMRS-ARI-C-SSR, and C-GAS at inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups: (1) those presenting juvenile bipolar disorder according to DSM 5 (BD+) and (2) those without criteria for bipolar disorder (BD-). Suicide risk factors and suicide attempt relapse were assessed at 3 and 12 months of follow-up. Results. - Twenty-six inpatients (22 female and 4 male) aged 14.5 years (SD 1,5) were consecutively included. Twenty patients were followed up during the 12-month period. At baseline, 5 patients (19.2 %) presented a diagnosis of BD (DSM-5): 1 BD type 2, 2 non specified BD, 2 cyclothymic disorders. According to the medical charts (ICD-10), none of the patients had been diagnosed with BD but had diagnoses of dysthymia, of borderline personality disorder and of conduct disorder corresponding to DMDD in 3, 2 and 1 patient respectively. During the 12-month follow-up, 9 patients of the BD- group and none of the BD+ presented recurrence of suicide attempt with 67 % during the first 3 months and 3 patients with multirelapses. These 3 patients were female adolescents out of care and carrying at least three suicide risk factors. Six patients have been lost to follow-up (1 BD+, 5 BD-). In the BD+ group, 3 patients out of 4 had a persistent diagnosis (DSM-5) of BD at 12 months. Conclusion. - In our adolescent population hospitalized for suicidal attempt, 19,2 % present BD using DSM-5 criteria. Diagnoses are stable during 12 months of follow-up, but under diagnosed in current clinical practice. DSM-5 standardized assessment appears to be very important to diagnose juvenile BD, mandatory for medium and long-term psychiatric follow-up, especially for suicide prevention and psychopharmacologic therapeutics. Nevertheless, no recurrence of suicide attempts has been observed in our BP+ group, contrary to BP-, possibly due the absence of BP 1 disorder. (C) 2017 L'Encephale, Paris."
444419500010,JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY,The value of inflammation based prognostic scores in patients undergoing surgical resection for oesophageal and gastric carcinoma,"Background and ObjectivesSurgical interventions for oesophagogastric cancer carry a significant burden of morbidity and mortality. A range of inflammation based prognostic scores have been proposed in an attempt to predict outcome. This study evaluated five such prognostic scores in oesophageal and gastric carcinoma patients. MethodsThe modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), Prognostic Index (PI), and Prognostic Nutrition Index (PNI) were calculated for 723 consecutive patients undergoing oesophagectomy or gastrectomy at a single center. The predictive accuracy of each score was assessed using ROC curves and survival analyses. ResultsOverall, only PLR and PNI were significantly predictive of patient survival (both P<0.001), with no significant association detected for mGPS (P=0.480), NLR (P=0.210), or PI (P=0.808). Subgroup analysis found the predictive accuracy of PNI to be significantly greater in oesophagectomy than gastrectomy patients (hazard ratio 2.75 vs 1.39, P=0.016) and mGPS to be predictive of patient survival only in oesophagectomies (P<0.001). ConclusionsInflammation based prognostic scores may have a role in patients undergoing resection for oesophageal and gastric cancer. These scores are easily calculable from routinely collected data and could be used as an adjunct to existing staging modalities."
433974400006,METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE,The Role of Grain Orientation and Grain Boundary Characteristics in the Mechanical Twinning Formation in a High Manganese Twinning-Induced Plasticity Steel,"In the current study, the dependence of mechanical twinning on grain orientation and grain boundary characteristics was investigated using quasi in-situ tensile testing. The grains of three main orientations (i.e., aOE (c) 111 >, aOE (c) 110 >, and aOE (c) 100 > parallel to the tensile axis (TA)) and certain characteristics of grain boundaries (i.e., the misorientation angle and the inclination angle between the grain boundary plane normal and the TA) were examined. Among the different orientations, aOE (c) 111 > and aOE (c) 100 > were the most and the least favored orientations for the formation of mechanical twins, respectively. The aOE (c) 110 > orientation was intermediate for twinning. The annealing twin boundaries appeared to be the most favorable grain boundaries for the nucleation of mechanical twinning. No dependence was found for the inclination angle of annealing twin boundaries, but the orientation of grains on either side of the annealing twin boundary exhibited a pronounced effect on the propensity for mechanical twinning. Annealing twin boundaries adjacent to high Taylor factor grains exhibited a pronounced tendency for twinning regardless of their inclination angle. In general, grain orientation has a significant influence on twinning on a specific grain boundary."
435250100007,CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS,Catalytically active nanorotor reversibly self-assembled by chemical signaling within an eight-component network,"A catalytically active three-component nanorotor is reversibly self-assembled and disassembled by remote control. When zinc(II) ions (2 equiv.) are added as an external chemical trigger to the mixture of transmitter [Cu(1)](+) and pre-rotor assembly [(S).(R)], two equiv. of copper(I) ions translocate from [Cu(1)](+) to the two phenanthroline sites of [(S).(R)]. As a result, [Zn(1)]2(+) forms along with the three-component assembly [Cu-2(S)(R)](2+), which is both a nanorotor (k(298) = 46 kHz, boolean AND H-double dagger = 49.1 + 0.4 kJ mol(-1), boolean AND S-double dagger = 9.5 + 1.7 J mol(-1) K-1) and a catalyst for click reactions (catalysis ON: A + B -> AB). Removal of zinc from the mixture reverts the translocation sequence and thus commands disassembly of the catalytically active rotor (catalysis OFF). The ON/OFF catalytic cycle was run twice in situ in the full network."

As a result of the batch extraction tests, maximum removals were determined as; at the 20:1 liquid: soil ratio for Pb is 60.7%, for Cd at the 30:1 liquid: soil ratio is 67.4%. An electrochemical treatment was applied to the waste washing solution which appeared to be the second pollutant after the Na(2)EDTA extraction from the soil. With extraction tests of Pb and Cd, being transformed from the solid phase to the liquid phase. The electrochemical treatment (electrodeposition), performed in three different potential (6 V, 8 V and 10 V) and maximum removal efficiencies, were found 99.7% and 80.3% at 10 V for Pb and Cd, respectively.Speciation tests (BCR) were carried out, both before and after the soil washing process, to evaluate the redistribution of metal fraction in the soil. The fraction, associated with the organic substance, was found as 10.67% for Pb and 1.81% for Cd. The metal bioavailability factor increased after soil washing, which indicates that EDTA could enhance the mobility of Pb and Cd."
427544000014,SENSORS,Secure Transmission of Cooperative Zero-Forcing Jamming for Two-User SWIPT Sensor Networks,"In this paper, the secrecy performance of the two-user simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) sensor networks is studied and a novel secure transmission scheme of cooperative zero-forcing (ZF) jamming is proposed. The two sensors opportunistically conduct the SWIPT and cooperative ZF jamming, respectively, where the energy required for jamming the eavesdropper is provided by the SWIPT operation so as to keep the energy balance at the sensors in the long run. By deriving the exact closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability and the secrecy throughout, we provide an effective approach to precisely assess the impacts of key parameters on the secrecy performance of the system. It has been shown that the secrecy outage probability is a monotonically increasing function of the growth of secrecy rate (R-s), and a monotonically decreasing function of the increase of the transmit signal-to-noise ratio (gamma(S)), and energy conversion efficiency (eta). Furthermore, the secrecy throughput could be enhanced when h increases, which becomes especially obvious when a large gamma(S) is provided. Moreover, the existence of an optimum R-s maximizing the secrecy throughput is depicted, which also grows with the increase of gamma(S). Simulations are provided for the validation of the analysis."

Considering time delays between the drive system and the response system in the process of synchronization, this paper designs one kind of flexible sandwich controller, which includes a rest in the sandwich structure, to realize the synchronization between two memristor-based hyperchaotic systems. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, matrix inequality, sandwich control and considering time delays, the exponential synchronization conditions for the memristor-based hyperchaotic systems with time delays via sandwich control are given. Finally, simulation results are displayed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of this method."
447255400003,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY,How Interdependent Are Stay/Leave Decisions? On Staying in the Relationship for the Sake of the Romantic Partner,"The decision to end a romantic relationship can have a life-changing impact on the partner as well as the self. Research on close relationships has thus far focused on self-interested reasons why people choose to stay in their relationship versus leave. However, a growing body of research on decision-making and prosociality shows that when people make decisions that impact others, they take those others' feelings and perspectives into consideration. In the present research, we tested the prediction that people make stay/leave decisions prosocially, such that consideration for their romantic partner's feelings can discourage people from ending their relationships. In Study 1, a total of 1,348 participants in romantic relationships were tracked over a 10-week period. Study 2 was a preregistered replication and extension of Study 1, in which 500 participants contemplating a breakup were followed over a 2-month period. Both studies showed that the more dependent people believed their partner was on the relationship, the less likely they were to initiate a breakup. These findings held above and beyond a variety of self-focused variables (e.g., investment model components; Rusbult, Martz, & Agnew, 1998). These results suggest that people can be motivated to stay in relatively unfulfilling relationships for the sake of their romantic partner."
451755500042,MATERIALS,Investigation the Corrosion Inhibition Effect of Itraconazole on Copper in H2SO4 at Different Temperatures: Combining Experimental and Theoretical Studies,"The anti-corrosion inhibition effect of itraconazole on copper (Cu) in 0.5 M H2SO4 is observed with variety of experimental methods, including electrochemical measurement, surface morphology analysis, and theoretical calculations. These experimental results all confirm that itraconazole exhibits excellent anti-corrosion performance in the certain temperatures range (298 K-313 K) for copper in sulfuric acid solution. In addition, corresponding adsorption isothermal models were used to fit the adsorption behavior of itraconazole on the copper surface. The results show that the Langmuir adsorption model agrees best with the experimental results. The adsorption of itraconazole on the copper surface belongs to chemical and physical adsorption."

435394000018,MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS,A novel missense mutation in the ACTG1 gene in a family with congenital autosomal dominant deafness: A case report,"The ACTG1 gene encodes the cytoskeletal protein -actin, which functions in non-muscle cells and is abundant in the auditory hair cells of the cochlea. Autosomal dominant missense mutations in ACTG1 are associated with DFNA20/26, a disorder that is typically characterized by post-lingual progressive hearing loss. To date, 17 missense mutations in ACTG1 have been reported in 20 families with DFNA20/26. The present study described a small family with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. A novel heterozygous missense mutation, c.94C>T (p.Pro32Ser), in ACTG1 was identified using the TruSight One sequencing panel. Notably, congenital hearing loss in our proband was identified by newborn hearing screening at birth. In silico predictions of protein structure and function indicate that the p.Pro32Ser mutation may result in conformational changes in -actin. The present study expands the understanding of the phenotypic effects of heterozygous missense mutations in the ACTG1 gene. In specific, the present results emphasize that mutations in ACTG1 result in a diverse spectrum of onset ages, including congenital in addition to post-lingual onset."
423835300001,REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND ENDOCRINOLOGY,Navigation problems of ICSI or naive blastocyst can be solved with artificial blastocyst,Embryos have evolved a remarkable capacity to find implantation site. The impressive navigation ability of natural blastocysts may rely on highly sensitive signals arising from embryos and specialized signal processing strategies in the endometrium. Navigation capabilities may be compromised in ICSI embryos because of altered biochemical signaling. The design and delivery of artificial blastocyst (AB) carrying strong chemical signals may allow ICSI embryos to more easily locate to and be retained in the implantation zone. ICSI embryos will attach easily to the implantation zone after it is found by the AB. Co-transfer of the AB together with the ICSI embryo may overcome potential difficulties in implantation due to impaired embryo-maternal communication in cases with implantation failure.

Chinese propolis (CP) has been shown to have a potent antitumor effect against various cancers. In this study, we uncovered the combined effects of antiproliferation and anti-inflammation of CP on suppressing the progression of human melanoma cell line A375. We evaluated the alterations of protein expression after CP treatment by Western blot. After CP treatment, A375 cells underwent intrinsic apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we found that CP suppressed inflammation in A375 cells. NLRP1 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 1), confirmed as a proinflammatory protein in melanoma progression, was downregulated significantly by CP, as were the NLRP1-related caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD) proteins, including caspase-1 and caspase-4. Additionally, decreasing mRNA levels of IL-1, IL-1, and IL-18 further proved the negative regulation of CP on the melanoma inflammatory environment. We also discovered that CP induced autophagy in A375 cells. Interestingly, inhibiting autophagy in CP-treated cells diminished its antitumor effect, suggesting that the autophagy was attributed to CP-induced apoptosis. Collectively, CP is a promising candidate for drug development for melanoma therapy."

The grafted SRs were activated by derivatization of GlyMA to 2-oxoethyl methacrylate using sodium periodate, enabling the chemical immobilization of lysozyme by covalent bonds. The presence of lysozyme was confirmed by non-specific assay and by the enzymatic activity at 30 degrees C with Micrococcus lysodeikticus (coccus, Gram-positive). The materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance, thermogravimetric analysis, water contact angle, and by mechanical properties as well as scanning electron microscope."
452360200017,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,Ecosystem services provision today and in the past: a comparative study in two Baltic lagoons,"The European Biodiversity Strategy asks EU Member States for an assessment, mapping and valuing of Ecosystem Services (ES). While terrestrial ES concept is advanced and different tools are available, they are largely lacking for coastal and marine systems. We develop a stepwise methodological process to assess ES in coastal and marine systems which we name Marine Ecosystem Services Assessment Tool. We applied it to two large Baltic lagoons, the Szczecin and the Curonian Lagoons demonstrating a quantitative and qualitative assessment approach. Firstly, an initial status is defined reflecting, according to the European Water Framework Directive, a past situation when the ecosystems where in a so called good ecological state. In both Baltic lagoons, this refers to a situation around 1960. Secondly, a present state is defined, assessed and compared to the initial status. Increasing anthropogenic impacts in Szczecin Lagoon caused an overall decrease ecological status which may influence the system's ability to provide services. Assessing ES changes semi-quantitatively via 39 indicators and 22 services, we show a decrease in provisioning and regulating and maintenance and an increase of cultural services' provision. According to 15 expert valuations, the Curonian Lagoon displays no changes in provisioning but an increase in regulating and maintenance and cultural service provision. We discuss how these results can serve different marine management approaches and support different polices. Through our application we show how the tool can be used to assess ES changes over time and thus provide key information on sustainable use and ES for future generations."
436912900014,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES,A non-intrusive technique to determine the spatially varying heat transfer coefficients in a flat plate with flush mounted heat sources,"In this work, a novel experimental technique is developed to estimate spatially varying heat transfer coefficients from a flat plate with flush mounted discrete heat sources, using Bayesian inference with temperature measurements from liquid crystal thermography (LCT) at an adiabatic surface of the plate without disturbing the fluid flow. Steady state, laminar forced convection experiments have been done on a flat Bakelite plate with three identical embedded discrete aluminium heat sources of dimensions 0.16 x 0.06 x 0.015 (l x w x t all in m). The variation of local convective heat transfer coefficient is obtained in the form of a Nusselt number correlation Nu = aRe(b) (x/l)(c). This correlation is first developed by limited numerical simulations for two dimensional conjugate convection. With this correlation, a computationally less complex problem of conjugate conduction in the flat plate also known as the forward model is repeatedly solved for various values of 'a', 'b' and 'c' to obtain the temperature distributions at select points on the adiabatic surface using COMSOL. A surrogate model obtained by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) built upon the data from these simulations then replaces the forward model. This surrogate model is used to drive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based Metropolis Hastings algorithm to generate the samples to the forward model to solve the inverse problem of getting 'a', 'b' and 'c' from temperature measurements at the adiabatic surface. Bayesian framework is then adopted to compare the experimental and the simulated temperatures to generate posteriors and the mean, maximum a posteriori and standard deviation of the parameters 'a', 'b' and 'c' are estimated. The effect of number of samples and the temperature points on the performance of the estimation process has been reported. Finally, with the retrieved values of 'a', 'b' and 'c' temperature distributions are obtained by solving the conduction problem and these are compared with those actually measured with TLC."
450068500009,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,Move on or take the heat: Can life history strategies of freshwater mussels predict their physiological and behavioural responses to drought and dewatering?,"Freshwater organisms have developed different physiological, behavioural and life history strategies to cope with drying events. Although freshwater mussels (Unionidae) are endangered and drought and dewatering events pose a major threat, especially in the southern United States, little is known about their responses to such events and how physiology, behaviour and life history strategies may be linked. Our goal was to examine whether and how behavioural responses to dewatering and physiological tolerances to desiccation are linked in five species of freshwater mussels (Unionidae) within Texas, including two state-threatened species (Cyclonaias petrina and Lampsilis bracteata) and one federally endangered species (Popenaias popeii), and to explore how differences in responses relate to life history strategies. We measured horizontal and vertical movements under three dewatering rates and assessed desiccation tolerance by examining survival after emersion at 30 and 40 degrees C with laboratory experiments. Amblema plicata and C. petrina had the lowest horizontal movement rates and the highest desiccation tolerances, whereas L. bracteata and L. teres were less tolerant to desiccation, but more mobile. P. popeii were intermediate in its responses. Our results show that differences between species in their behavioural response to dewatering and physiological tolerance to desiccation tend to be associated with differences in life history strategies or may be explained by differences in adaptation to certain habitat conditions. We propose a life history strategy-based framework for responses of mussels to drying events, which may be applicable to other taxa."

This study summarized the Shandong CV-A4 strains isolated from 25 years acute flaccid paralysis surveillance, with an emphasis on exploring the phylogenetic analyses and spatiotemporal dynamics of CV-A4 at the global scale. We sampled 43 CV-A4 isolates and utilized VP1 gene to construct phylogenetic trees. Further extensive Bayesian phylogeographic analysis was carried out to investigate the evolution of CV-A4 and understand the spatiotemporal diffusion around the world using BEAST and SPREAD software. Phylogenetic trees showed that CV-A4 emerged to be more active in recent decades and multiple transmission chains were co-circulating. The molecular clock analysis estimated a mean evolutionary rate of 6.4 x 10(-3) substitutions/site/year, and the estimated origin of CV-A4 around 1944. The phylogeographic analyses suggested the origin of CV-A4 could be in the USA, however regional dissemination was mainly located around the Asia-Europe region. The spatiotemporal dynamics of CV-A4 exhibited frequent viral traffic among localities, and virus from Shandong province seemed to have played a central role in spreading around China and neighboring countries. Our phylogenetic description and phylogeographic analyses indicate the importance of large spatial- and temporal-scale studies in understanding epidemiological dynamics of CV-A4, particularly the diffusion routes will be of great importance to global control efforts."

The composites were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and photoluminescene (PL). The photocatalytic activities of Bi2WO6/Cu1.8Se are evaluated by degrading Congo red solution and hydrogen generation from water. It was found that the molar percentage of Cu1.8Se had great effects on the morphology and photocatalytic property of the Bi2WO6/Cu1.8Se heterojunctions, and the composite with suitable molar amount of Cu1.8Se exhibits much enhanced photocatalytic activity for Congo red degradation under visible and near-infrared light irradiation and for hydrogen generation under visible light compared to Bi2WO6. The significant improvement photocatalytic activity of the composite could be attributed to its good light absorption, suitable band gap structure, and effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs of Bi2WO6/Cu1.8Se heterojunction. This work presents an efficient multifunction photocatalyst owning the activity both for water splitting under visible light and for organic contaminants decomposition under visible-near-infrared light."
433593300011,PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Optimization of radial-type superconducting magnetic bearing using the Taguchi method,"It is important and complicated to model and optimize the levitation behavior of superconducting magnetic bearing (SMB). That is due to the nonlinear constitutive relationships of superconductor and ferromagnetic materials, the relative movement between the superconducting stator and PM rotor, and the multi-parameter (e.g., air-gap, critical current density, and remanent flux density, etc.) affecting the levitation behavior. In this paper, we present a theoretical calculation and optimization method of the levitation behavior for radial-type SMB. A simplified model of levitation force calculation is established using 2D finite element method with Hformulation. In the model, the boundary condition of superconducting stator is imposed by harmonic series expressions to describe the traveling magnetic field generated by the moving PM rotor. Also, experimental measurements of the levitation force are performed and validate the model method. A statistical method called Taguchi method is adopted to carry out an optimization of load capacity for SMB. Then the factor effects of six optimization parameters on the target characteristics are discussed and the optimum parameters combination is determined finally. The results show that the levitation behavior of SMB is greatly improved and the Taguchi method is suitable for optimizing the SMB."
426005600001,LASER PHYSICS,Modification of optical properties by adiabatic shifting of resonances in a four-level atom,"We describe the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a four-level atomic system, after reducing it to an effective two-level atomic model under the condition of adiabatic shifting of resonances driven by two coherent off-resonant fields. The reduced form of the Hamiltonian corresponding to the two-level system is obtained by employing an adiabatic elimination procedure in the rate equations of the probability amplitudes for the proposed four-level model. For a weak probe field operating in the system, the nonlinear dependence of complex susceptibility on the Rabi frequencies and the detuning parameters of the off-resonant driving fields makes it possible to exhibit coherent control of single-photon and two-photon absorption and transparency, the evolution of enhanced Self-Kerr nonlinearity and noticeable dispersive switching. We have shown how the quantum interference results in the generic four-level model at the adiabatic limit. The present scheme describes the appearance of single-photon transparency without invoking any exact two-photon resonance."

However, little is known about the synaptic processes underlying cognitive loss in ADHD, or those ultimately involved in the preventive effect observed through the clinical use of Atomoxetine (ATX). To investigate the plasticity underlying ADHD related cognitive loss, and that potentially involved in the preventive action of Atomoxetine, allocentric VWM was assessed, as well as the dendritic spine number and proportional density on pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cerebral cortex layer III of neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. The effect of acute ATX treatment was also assessed at 28 days of age. 6-OHDA induced lesions produced increased motor activity and a loss of VWM, concomitant with a reduction in thin spine density. ATX administration reversed cognitive loss, in conjunction with a decrease in thin spines and an increase in mushroom spines. A reduction in the proportion of spines involved in learning in hyperactive animals could account for the loss in cognitive function observed. Considering thin spine density was also reduced after ATX administration, we hypothesized that the restoration in cognitive function recorded could be brought about by an increase in memory related mushroom spines."
435743400027,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,Estimating River Surface Elevation From ArcticDEM,"ArcticDEM is a collection of 2-m resolution, repeat digital surface models created from stereoscopic satellite imagery. To demonstrate the potential of ArcticDEM for measuring river stages and discharges, we estimate river surface heights along a reach of Tanana River near Fairbanks, Alaska, by the precise detection of river shorelines and mapping of shorelines to land surface elevation. The river height profiles over a 15-km reach agree with in situ measurements to a standard deviation less than 30 cm. The time series of ArcticDEM-derived river heights agree with the U.S. Geological Survey gage measurements with a standard deviation of 32 cm. Using the rating curve for that gage, we obtain discharges with a validation accuracy (root-mean-square error) of 234 m(3)/s (23% of the mean discharge). Our results demonstrate that ArcticDEM can accurately measure spatial and temporal variations of river surfaces, providing a new and powerful data set for hydrologic analysis."
426126900004,ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS,Jupiter's evolution with primordial composition gradients,"Recent formation and structure models of Jupiter suggest that the planet can have composition gradients and not be fully convective (adiabatic). This possibility directly affects our understanding of Jupiter's bulk composition and origin. In this Letter we present Jupiter's evolution with a primordial structure consisting of a relatively steep heavy- element gradient of 40 M-circle plus. We show that for a primordial structure with composition gradients, most of the mixing occurs in the outer part of the gradient during the early evolution (several 107 yr), leading to an adiabatic outer envelope (60% of Jupiter's mass). We find that the composition gradient in the deep interior persists, suggesting that similar to 40% of Jupiter's mass can be non- adiabatic with a higher temperature than the one derived from Jupiter's atmospheric properties. The region that can potentially develop layered convection in Jupiter today is estimated to be limited to similar to 10% of the mass."

First, force analysis is conducted on each leg of the HN-EXO, and the Newton-Euler method is adopted to establish the relationship between the driven torques and the forces at the spherical joint. Second, a dynamic analysis is performed on the sensor group, and the relationship between the forces at the spherical joint and the feedback of the sensor assembled in the joint space is established. Third, the equation between the driven torque and the feedback of the sensor is derived based on the previous work. Fourth, Newton-Euler dynamic equations are incorporated into the system to determine the relationship between the human-machine interactive force and the feedback of the sensors. Finally, an experiment is conducted, the results of which are as follows. (1) The performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the existing one in terms of effectiveness, accuracy, and stability. (2) The maximum calculating time of the new method is 4.25x10(-4) s, which is one-fifth of the control cycle period. Therefore, the new algorithm can be adopted to accomplish real-time control under the frequency of 500 Hz."
437070800027,GENE,MEF2A regulates Calpain 3 expression in L6 myoblasts,"Calpain 3 (Capn3), a skeletal muscle-specific member of the calpain family, executes some non-proteolytic functions besides its role as a Ca2+-tregulated proteolytic enzyme. Previously, we found that changes in Capn3 expression were linearly correlated with the degree of muscular atrophy following reversible sciatic nerve injury and that knockdown of Capn3 gene expression promoted myoblast differentiation. While the regulation of capn3 gene expression is interesting, transcriptional regulation of Capn3 is still unclear. In the present study, we provided experimental data showing that the myogenic enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) regulated Capn3 gene expression. Firstly, the luciferase reporter assay and EMSA were performed and showed that ectopic expression of the Mef2a gene could bind to the predicted site of the Capn3 promoter region. Furthermore, in the L6 myoblast differentiation model in vitro, Capn3 gene expression was shown to be positively associated with the level of Mef2a by qRT-PCR, western-blotting, and immunocytochemistry. The Capn3 protein level decreased as MEF2A decreased when induced by Mef2a siRNA transfection in L6 myoblasts. Finally, the results of ChIP indicated that MEF2A occupied the promoter region of the Capn3 gene in rat denervated gastrocnemius muscle tissue. Based on these results, we proposed that MEF2A is a transcriptional regulator for Capn3 gene expression."
431268900031,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,"A rabies lesson improves rabies knowledge amongst primary school children in Zomba, Malawi","Rabies is an important neglected disease, which kills around 59,000 people a year. Over a third of these deaths are in children less than 15 years of age. Almost all human rabies deaths in Africa and Asia are due to bites from infected dogs. Despite the high efficacy of current rabies vaccines, awareness about rabies preventive healthcare is often low in endemic areas. It is therefore common for educational initiatives to be conducted in conjunction with other rabies control activities such as mass dog vaccination, however there are few examples where the efficacy of education activities has been assessed. Here, primary school children in Zomba, Malawi, were given a lesson on rabies biology and preventive healthcare. Subsequently, a mass dog vaccination programme was delivered in the same region. Knowledge and attitudes towards rabies were assessed by a questionnaire before the lesson, immediately after the lesson and 9 weeks later to assess the impact the lesson had on school children's knowledge and attitudes. This assessment was also undertaken in children who were exposed to the mass dog vaccination programme but did not receive the lesson. Knowledge of rabies and how to be safe around dogs increased following the lesson (both p<0.001), and knowledge remained higher than baseline 9 weeks after the lesson (both p<0.001). Knowledge of rabies and how to be safe around dogs was greater amongst school children who had received the lesson compared to school children who had not received the lesson, but had been exposed to a rabies vaccination campaign in their community (both p<0.001) indicating that the lesson itself was critical in improving knowledge. In summary, we have shown that a short, focused classroom-based lesson on rabies can improve short and medium-term rabies knowledge and attitudes of Malawian schoolchildren."
443616400038,METALS,The In-Plane Structure and Dynamic Property of the Homogeneous Al-Al Solid-Liquid Interface,"Using molecular dynamics simulation and a newly developed COMB3 potential, the in-plane ordering and diffusion constant profiles at the homogeneous (100), (110), and (111) interfaces between solid and liquid Al have been examined. We found that the in-plane ordering characterized by 2-D density maps and 2-D structure factors existed in the first 6, 10, and 3 out-of-plane layers at the (100), (110), and (111) interfaces, respectively, showing a strong dependence on substrate orientation. In layers with in-plane ordering, the diffusion constant is greatly reduced relative to its value in the bulk liquid, while the influence of layers without in-plane ordering is negligible. The three diffusivity components turn out to be isotropic at the homogeneous interfaces. The Al-Al interfaces studied here will serve as an important reference in comparisons of the structure and properties of different solid-liquid interfaces, which will greatly support the design of grain refiners."

448098600042,ENERGY,A collaborative control optimization of grid-connected net zero energy buildings for performance improvements at building group level,"Due to inherent differences in building usage and system configuration, NZEBs frequently show different sufficiency of renewable energy at same moments, thereby providing chances of renewable-energy-sharing among NZEBs. Conventional controls are developed for NZEB performance improvements at single building level while potential collaborations (renewable energy sharing) between NZEBs are rarely considered. For this reason, they are unable to achieve optimized results at building group level. This study thus proposes a new collaborative control in which renewable energy sharing are realized among NZEBs. Adopting different objective functions, case studies have been conducted to compare the proposed control with a conventional one in two aspects, i.e. operation cost and grid friendliness. The study results have shown that the proposed collaborative control is able to achieve performance improvements through renewable energy sharing among NZEB5. The proposed collaborative control can be implemented in practice to realize renewable energy sharing among NZEBs and thus improve the cost effectiveness and grid friendliness at building group level.

428304300002,ENERGIES,A Voltage and Frequency Control Strategy for Stand-Alone Full Converter Wind Energy Conversion Systems,"This paper addresses the design and analysis of a voltage and frequency control (VFC) strategy for full converter (FC)-based wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) and its applicability for the supply of an isolated load. When supplying an isolated load, the role of the back-to-back converters in the FC must change with respect to a grid-connected application. Voltage and frequency are established by the FC line side converter (LSC), while the generator side converter (GSC) is responsible for maintaining constant voltage in the DC link. Thus, the roles of the converters in the WECS are inverted. Under such control strategies, the LSC will automatically supply the load power and hence, in order to maintain a stable operation of the WECS, the wind turbine (WT) power must also be controlled in a load-following strategy. The proposed VFC is fully modelled and a stability analysis is performed. Then, the operation of the WECS under the proposed VFC is simulated and tested on a real-time test bench, demonstrating the performance of the VFC for the isolated operation of the WECS."

Objective To investigate the ultrasound manifestation of AIT in relation to PTC development in paediatric patients. Patients 179 paediatric patients (133 females), mean (SD) age: 13.9 (3.03) years diagnosed with AIT and referred for ultrasound evaluation. Eight patients were diagnosed with PTC (6 females). Methods Retrospective analysis of thyroid ultrasound scans of patients diagnosed with AIT. Thyroid and autoimmune status was assessed based on TSH, fT4, fT3 and increased aTPO and/or aTG and/or TRAB levels. In patients with PTC, total thyroidectomy was performed. Results Analysis of thyroid US scans revealed that the following five ultrasound variants of AIT were observed in 179 patients: the most common in 35.2%-diffuse thyroiditis with hypoechogenic background and normoechogenic parenchyma, in 30.2%-diffuse thyroiditis with irregular background, in 18.9% nodular variant with normoechogenic background, in 11.7%-micronodulations and in 3.9%-diffuse hypoechogenic background. Eight cases of PTC were diagnosed in nodular variant of AIT with normoechogenic irregular background. Conclusion Patients with AIT and nodular variant with normoechogenic irregular background of the thyroid gland on US scans are in the risk group of developing PTC and should be followed up with regular neck US assessment."
445990000036,CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW,Early Head Start dosage: The role of parent-caregiver relationships and family involvement,"The present study examined predictors and pathways relevant to children's dosage in Early Head Start (EHS) using the dataset from the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study (Baby FACES; Vogel & Boller, 2009-2012). Dosage was defined in two ways: (a) leaving EHS early, before age eligibility ended, and (b) the total length of EHS enrollment. This study first examined factors predicting children's dosage of EHS with a particular focus on parent-caregiver relationships captured when children were age 1. Second, this study examined a potential mediational role of family involvement on the association between parent-caregiver relationships and EHS dosage, controlling for child and family characteristics. Findings showed that children from families with higher risks were more likely to leave EHS early and were enrolled in EHS for less time. Children were less likely to leave EHS early when their caregivers reported positive relationships with parents when children were age 1. However, the length of EHS enrollment was not predicted by parent-caregiver relationships as reported either by parents or caregivers. Findings from mediation models showed that caregiver-reported positive parent-caregiver relationships were associated with the higher level of family involvement during EHS which, in turn, predicted both lower rates of early leaving and longer length of EHS enrollment. These results indicate that promoting initial positive parent-caregiver relationships and encouraging family involvement in EHS may be important for maximizing children's EHS dosage, which has been shown to be beneficial for the development of children in EHS."
437146400011,JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS,Vapor Phase Growth of High-Quality Bi-Te Compounds Using Elemental Bi and Te Sources: A Comparison Between High Vacuum and Atmospheric Pressure,"Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), traditionally used in the industry as thermoelectric material, has deserved much attention recently due to its properties as a topological insulator, a kind of material that might have relevant applications in spintronics or quantum computing, among other innovative uses. The preparation of high-quality material has become a very important technological task. Here, we compare the preparation of Bi2Te3 by physical vapor transport from the evaporation of elemental Bi and Te sources, under either low pressure or atmospheric pressure. The layers were characterized by different techniques to evaluate its structural properties. As a result, it is concluded that, as a consequence of the different transport regimes, films grown at atmospheric pressure present better crystal quality."
428165400014,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,A genomics approach reveals insights into the importance of gene losses for mammalian adaptations,"Identifying the genomic changes that underlie phenotypic adaptations is a key challenge in evolutionary biology and genomics. Loss of protein-coding genes is one type of genomic change with the potential to affect phenotypic evolution. Here, we develop a genomics approach to accurately detect gene losses and investigate their importance for adaptive evolution in mammals. We discover a number of gene losses that likely contributed to morphological, physiological, and metabolic adaptations in aquatic and flying mammals. These gene losses shed light on possible molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie these adaptive phenotypes. In addition, we show that gene loss events that occur as a consequence of relaxed selection following adaptation provide novel insights into species' biology. Our results suggest that gene loss is an evolutionary mechanism for adaptation that may be more widespread than previously anticipated. Hence, investigating gene losses has great potential to reveal the genomic basis underlying macroevolutionary changes."
426145800102,CHEMICAL SENSES,Sweet Emotion: The Role of Odor-induced Context in the Search Advantage for Happy Facial Expressions,"The current study investigated the extent to which the concurrent presentation of pleasant and unpleasant odors could modulate the perceptual saliency of happy facial expressions in an emotional visual search task. Whilst a search advantage for happy faces was found in the no odor and unpleasant odor conditions, it was abolished under the pleasant odor condition. Furthermore, phasic properties of visual search performance revealed the malleable nature of this happiness advantage. Specifically, attention towards happy faces was optimized at the start of the visual search task for participants presented with pleasant odors, but diminished towards the end. This pattern was reversed for participants in the unpleasant odor condition. These patterns occur through the emotion-inducing capacities of odors and highlight the circumstances in which top-down factors can override perceptually salient facial features in emotional visual search."
451458600014,NATURE PHOTONICS,Experimental quantum fast hitting on hexagonal graphs,"Quantum walks are powerful kernels in quantum computing protocols, and possess strong capabilities in speeding up various simulation and optimization tasks. One striking example is provided by quantum walkers evolving on glued trees(1), which demonstrate faster hitting performances than classical random walks. However, their experimental implementation is challenging, as this involves highly complex arrangements of an exponentially increasing number of nodes. Here, we propose an alternative structure with a polynomially increasing number of nodes. We successfully map such graphs on quantum photonic chips using femtosecond-laser direct writing techniques in a geometrically scalable fashion. We experimentally demonstrate quantum fast hitting by implementing two-dimensional quantum walks on graphs with up to 160 nodes and a depth of eight layers, achieving a linear relationship between the optimal hitting time and the network depth. Our results open up a scalable path towards quantum speedup in classically intractable complex problems."
455648700004,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,Inverse Determination of the Influence of Fire on Vegetation Carbon Turnover in the Pantropics,"Fire is a major component of the terrestrial carbon cycle that has been implemented in most current global terrestrial ecosystem models. Here we use terrestrial carbon cycle observations to characterize the importance of fire regime gradients in the spatial distribution of ecosystem functional properties such as carbon allocation, fluxes, and turnover times in the tropics. A Bayesian model-data fusion approach is applied to an ecosystem carbon model to derive the posterior distribution of corresponding parameters for the tropics from 2000 to 2015. We perform the model-data fusion procedure twice, that is, with and without imposing fire. Gradient of differences in model parameters and ecosystem properties in response to fire emerge between these experiments. For example, mean annual burned fraction correlates with an increase in carbon use efficiency and reductions in carbon turnover times. Further, our analyses reveal an increased allocation to more fire-resistant tissues in the most frequently burned regions. As fire modules are increasingly implemented in global terrestrial ecosystem models, we recommend that model development includes a representation of the impact of fire on ecosystem properties as they may lead to large differences under climate change projections."
447623200011,ONCOLOGY RESEARCH,MicroRNA-744 Inhibits Cellular Proliferation and Invasion of Colorectal Cancer by Directly Targeting Oncogene Notch1,"Accumulated studies have strongly implicated aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in carcinogenesis and cancer progression of various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Hence, a comprehensive study of miRNAs and their association with CRC may be a promising therapeutic method for patients with this malignancy. MicroRNA-744 (miR-744) is abnormally expressed in several types of human cancer. Thus far, little is known about the expression, biological roles, and exact mechanisms of miR-744 in CRC. Thus, the present study measured the expression level of miR-744 and investigated its roles and associated molecular mechanisms in CRC. This study demonstrated that miR-744 expression was significantly underexpressed in CRC tissues and cell lines. Low miR-744 expression was positively associated with lymphatic metastasis and TNM stage. Functional experiments revealed that miR-744 overexpression obviously inhibited the proliferation and invasion of CRC cells. Furthermore, Notch1 was identified as a direct target of miR-744 in CRC. Moreover, the inhibition of Notch1 phenocopied the inhibitory effects of miR-744 overexpression on CRC cells. Restored Notch1 expression markedly rescued the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-744 overexpression on CRC cells. Overall, miR-744 exhibits an essential role in CRC progression, and the miR-744/Notch1 axis may provide novel insights into future treatments for patients with CRC."

442706700047,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,Impact of Environmental Radiation on the Health and Reproductive Status of Fish from Chernobyl,"Aquatic organisms at Chernobyl have now been chronically exposed to environmental radiation for three decades. The biological effects of acute exposure to radiation are relatively well documented, but much less is known about the long-term effects of chronic exposure of organisms in their natural environment. Highly exposed fish in freshwater systems at Chernobyl showed morphological changes in their reproductive system in the years after the accident. However, the relatively limited scope of past studies did not allow robust conclusions to be drawn. Moreover, the level of the radiation dose at which significant effects on wildlife occur is still under debate. In the most comprehensive evaluation of the effects of chronic radiation on wild fish populations to date, the present study measures specific activities of Cs-137, Sr-90, and transuranium elements (Pu-238, Pu-239,Pu-240, and Am-241), index conditions, distribution and size of oocytes, as well as environmental and biological confounding factors in two fish species perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) from seven lakes. In addition, relative species abundance was examined. The results showed that both fish species are, perhaps surprisingly, in good general physiological and reproductive health. Perch, however, appeared to be more sensitive to radiation than roach: in the most contaminated lakes, a delay of the maturation of the gonads and the presence of several undeveloped phenotypes were evident only for perch and not for roach."
445410200013,POLYMERS,Layer-by-Layer Self-Assembly Strategy for Surface Modification of Aramid Fibers to Enhance Interfacial Adhesion to Epoxy Resin,"In this work, the layer-by-layer self-assembly technology was used to modify aramid fibers (AFs) to improve the interfacial adhesion to epoxy matrix. By virtue of the facile layer-by-layer self-assembly technique, poly(L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine) (L-PDOPA) was successfully coated on the surface of AFs, leading to the formation of AFs with controllable layers (nL-AF). Then, a hydroxyl functionalized silane coupling agent (KH550) was grafted on the surface of L-PDOPA coated AFs. The properties such as microstructure and surface morphology of AFs before and after modification were characterized by FTIR, XPS and FE-SEM. The results confirmed that L-PDOPA and KH550 were successfully introduced into the surface of AFs by electrostatic adsorption. The interfacial properties of AFs reinforced epoxy resin composites before and after coating were characterized by interfacial shear strength (IFSS), interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and FE-SEM, and the results show that the interfacial adhesion properties of the modified fiber/epoxy resin composites were greatly improved."
415219100120,APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE,XPS analysis of PE and EVA samples irradiated at different gamma-doses,"The principal plastic materials used for the fluid contact and storage in the biopharmaceutical industry are mainly made up of semi-crystalline polymers, polyolefins, PVC, Siloxane and PET. The polyethylene (PE) and the polypropylene (PP) are often used as fluid contact in multi-layer materials like films. As one sterilisation way of single-use plastic devices used in medical and pharmaceutical fields can take place via gamma-irradiation, the effect of sterilization on plastics must be investigated. The irradiation process leads to the production of radicals, which can generate changes in the polymer structure and on the polymer surface. It is well known that the presence of oxygen with free radicals precede the generation of peroxide species so called ROS (reactive oxygen species) which are highly reactive. The purpose of this work is to investigate the gamma-rays impact on the surface of PE (polyethylene) and EVA (polyethylene vinyl alcohol) based films when ionized at different doses. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to determine the surface compositions of the polymers to highlight the different chemical moieties generated during the gamma-irradiation process and to monitor the potential presence of the ROS.

It proposes an understanding of reflection as situated and motivated from within a world and having a normative aspect that concerns the very life of the reflecting person. On this account, the paper argues, on the one hand, that both phenomenological reflection and hyperreflexivity can be viewed as forms of reflection characterized by loss of the world. On the other hand, by construing the phenomenological loss as imaginative vis-a-vis the real loss of hyperreflexivity, the paper emphasizes a difference between the two domains."

435020300002,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,Enhancing the Optical Absorption and Interfacial Properties of BiVO4 with Ag3PO4 Nanoparticles for Efficient Water Splitting,"Photoelectrochemical water splitting using semiconductor materials has emerged as a promising approach to produce hydrogen (H-2) from renewable resources such as sunlight and water. In the present study, Ag3PO4 nanoparticles were electrodeposited on BiVO4 photoanodes for water splitting. A remarkable water oxidation photocurrent of 2.3 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode with similar to 100% Faradaic efficiency was obtained, which constitutes a notable increase compared to the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. It is demonstrated that the enhancement of optical absorption (above-band gap absorbance) and the decrease of surface losses after the optimized deposition of Ag/Ag3PO4 nanoparticles are responsible for this notable performance. Remarkably, this heterostructure shows promising stability, demonstrating 25% decrease of photocurrent after 24 h continuous operation. This approach may open new avenues for technologically exploitable water oxidation photoanodes based on metal oxides."
423431200032,JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE,Challenging the great vascular wall: Can we envision a simple yet comprehensive therapy for stroke?,"Stroke is a leading cause of death in adult life, closely behind ischemic heart disease, and causes a significant and abiding socioeconomic burden. However, current therapies are not able to ensure full neurologic and/or sequelae-free recovery to all stroke survivors. We believe treatment efficacy and patient rehabilitation could be enhanced significantly by targeting blood-brain barrier (BBB) deregulation and inflammation-induced barrier loss that occurs after stroke. In this pathological context, bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) enter the bloodstream towards the lesion site, but their insufficient numbers and impaired angiogenic ability compromise neurovascular regeneration. In this context, cell-based therapies have become increasingly appealing since treating patients with large numbers of mesenchymal or hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells alone may boost repair. However, this approach could be met with several challenges in terms of logistics and cost; hence, the development of a drug delivery system suitable for intravenous administration and functionalized for selective uptake by circulating EPC could enhance their restorative potential without perceived complications. The ability to encapsulate proangiogenic and anti-inflammatory agents, such as retinoic acid, and to safely and easily deliver them systemically may open new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders.

It is an intervention based on home visits targeting first-time mothers from disadvantaged populations. Pro Kind was implemented as a randomized control trial from 2006 to 2012 with N = 755 first-time mothers (TG n = 394, CG n = 391). The 7-8-year follow-up aims to assess the mid-term effects of the program. Methods/design: Mid-term outcomes are being assessed by trained assessors. In a multimethod approach telephone interviews, on-site interviews, observations and developmental tests will be held in order to assess children's and mothers' life satisfaction, mental health, cognitive and social development, parenting behavior, signs of child abuse or neglect as well as the family's socio-economic status. Furthermore, administrative data will be accessed to obtain information regarding the mother's usage of pediatric health care, welfare usage and employment history. Discussion: Results regarding the mid-term effects of the intervention from the Pro Kind Follow-up will provide a scientific basis for future primary prevention programs as well as help stakeholders legitimizing early childhood investments."
455260900004,JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY,Analysis of influencing factors on suction capacity in seabed natural gas hydrate by cutter-suction exploitation,"The mathematical and simulation models of working head in the deep-sea working environment were built to analyze the effects of cutter-suction flow, cutter-head rotating speed, cutting depth and suction port position on the cutter-suction capacity. The efficiency of the cutter-suction is analyzed based on the analysis of the variation law of the solid-phase volume fraction of the flow field, the variation law of the velocity distribution in the flow field and the distribution law of the solid-phase concentration. The results show that the increase of cutter-suction flow can significantly improve the cutter-suction efficiency when it is less than 1000 m(3)/h. However, when it is more than 1000 m(3)/h, it is helpless. When the cutter-head rotate speed is within the range of 10-25 r/min, the cutter-suction efficiency stabilizes at about 95%. While the speed is greater than 25 r/min, the cutter-suction efficiency decreases sharply with the increase of cutter-head rotate speed. With the increase of cutting depth, the cutter-suction efficiency first increases and then remains stable and finally decreases. The cutter-suction efficiency remains at about 94% when the suction port position deviation ranges from 0 degrees to 30 degrees, but it has a sharply reduction when the deviation angle is more than 30 degrees."

HPAIV H5N8B showed increased virulence with rapid onset of severe disease and mortality in Pekin ducks due to pronounced neuro-and hepatotropism. Cross-species infection was evaluated in mice, ferrets, and in a human lung explant culture model. While the H5N8B isolate was highly virulent for Balb/c mice, virulence and transmissibility were grossly reduced in ferrets, which was mirrored by marginal replication in human lung cultures infected ex vivo. Our data indicate that the 2016 HPAIV H5N8B is avian-adapted with augmented virulence for waterfowl, but has low zoonotic potential. The here tested combination of animal studies with the inoculation of human explants provides a promising future workflow to evaluate zoonotic potential, mammalian replication competence and avian virulence of HPAIV."

433395000001,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,Recovery of Repressed Memories in Fibromyalgia Patients Treated With Hyperbaric Oxygen - Case Series Presentation and Suggested Bio-Psycho-Social Mechanism,"Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a condition considered to represent a prototype of central sensitization syndrome, characterized by chronic widespread pain and along with symptoms of fatigue, non-restorative sleep and cognitive difficulties. FMS can be induced by trauma, infection or emotional stress with cumulative evidence that dissociation is relatively frequent in FMS patients. Two randomized controlled trials have shown that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can induce neuroplasticity and be effective in patients suffering from FMS. In this paper we present, for the first time, case series of female fibromyalgia patients who, in the course of HBOT, suddenly recalled repressed traumatic memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). The surfacing of the repressed (dissociative) memories decades after the sexual abuse events was sudden and utterly surprising. No psychological intervention was involved. As the memories surfaced, the physical pain related to FMS subsided. In one patient who had brain single photon emission CT (SPECT) before and after HBOT, the prefrontal cortex appeared suppressed before and reactivated after. The 3 cases reported in this article are representative of a total of nine fibromyalgia patients who experienced a retrieval of repressed memory during HBOT. These cases provide insights on dissociative amnesia and suggested mechanism hypothesis that is further discussed in the article. Obviously, prospective studies cannot be planned since patients are not aware of their repressed memories. However, it is very important to keep in mind the possibility of surfacing memories when treating fibromyalgia patients with HBOT or other interventions capable of awakening dormant brain regions."
423005000028,APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING,Homogenization of very rough interfaces for the micropolar elasticity theory,"In this paper, the homogenization of a very rough two-dimensional interface separating two dissimilar isotropic micropolar elastic solids is investigated. The interface is assumed to oscillate between two parallel straight lines. The main aim is to derive homogenized equations in explicit form. These equations are obtained by the homogenization method along with the matrix formalism of the theory of micropolar elasticity. Since obtained homogenized equations are totally explicit, they are a powerful tool for solving various practical problems. As an example, the reflection and transmission of a longitudinal displacement plane wave at a very rough interface of tooth-comb type is investigated. The closed-form formulas for the reflection and transmission coefficients have been derived. Based on these formulas, some numerical examples are carried out to show the dependence of the reflection and transmission coefficients on the incident angle and the geometry parameter of the interface.

450233400001,MATERIALS SCIENCE-MEDZIAGOTYRA,Nano alpha-FeOOH Modified Carbon Paste Electrode for Arsenic Determination in Natural Waters,"A novel method for determination of inorganic arsenic in natural water, based on nano ferric hydroxides (FeOOH) preconcentration and electrochemistry detection has been developed. As the nano alpha-FeOOH could successfully act as the adsorbent and electrode matrix modifier, the method presents great potential in practical routine analysis of inorganic arsenic. With optimization of the experimental conditions, nano alpha-FeOOH modified carbon paste electrode (alpha-FeOOH@CPE) was obtained by mixing 0.03 g of nano alpha-FeOOH and 0.02 g graphite powder in n-eicosane as an adhesive and then embedding them in a Teflon tube. Cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and high resolution transmission electron microscopy were used to check and confirm the presence of nano alpha-FeOOH on the carbon paste electrodes. According to the results, alpha-FeOOH@CPE showed a considerably higher response to As(III) in comparison with the bare CPE, indicating the alpha-FeOOH has well selective enrichment for As(III). The developed modified electrode showed a linear range of 1.0 X 10(-8) similar to 2.0 X 10(-5) mol.L(-1 )and detection limit of 5.0 nmol.L-1 (S/N = 3). The newly prepared carbon paste electrode was successfully applied for As(III) determination in Yangzonghai Lake water with RSD of less than 3.6 % (n = 3) and recovery in the range of 100.7 similar to 115.0 %."
448226100014,INDIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,Quality of Life (QoL) and the Factors Affecting it in Transfusion-dependent Thalassemic Children,"Objectives To evaluate the Quality of life (QoL) and the factors affecting it in transfusion-dependent thalassemic children. Methods Current study was conducted at Department of Pediatrics, Dr. SNMC, Jodhpur. Ninety-three transfusion-dependent thalassemic children aged between 8 and 18 y were enrolled. Quality of life was assessed using Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) measurement model in thalassemic children. Results Mean age of children was 11.8 +/- 3.2 y. Lowest mean score was observed in School functioning (57.4) while in Physical functioning, Emotional functioning and Social functioning it was 73.9, 82.2 and 83.49 respectively. Mean PedsQL score was higher in 8-12 y age group as compared to 13-18 y (p = 0.024). PedsQL score was higher in children who required transfusion once in a month (p = 0.028) and children on combined chelation therapy as compared to children who were on injectable chelator (p = 0.039). Health Related QoL was not affected with gender, education status, family history of thalassemia, ferritin level, splenectomy or consanguinity. Conclusions Factors related with low QoL in current study were higher age, increased transfusion frequency and injectable mode of chelation. In order to improve the QoL in thalassemic children appropriate programmes and interventions should be started targeting above domains."
456045500005,GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL,An improved U-Pb age dating method for detrital zircon by LA-MC-ICP-MS,"Detrital zircon U-Pb dating is a powerful tool to trace sources for sedimentary basin and to understand of geological history in structurally complex areas. This study established an analytical protocol for measurement of detrital zircon U-Pb age by LA-MC-ICP-MS. Because detrital zircons normally have a large Pb content variation (several ppm to hundred ppm), which leads to large variations for Pb signal intensity, two sets of detector arrays were used. For Pb-rich zircons, Pb-206 was collected with Faraday cup detector array, while for Pb-poor zircons, Pb-206 was collected with ion counter detector array. The results of Pb-206/U-238 age and Pb-207/U-235 age for six well-known and widely used zircon standards agree within 0.5% and 1% respectively of the preferred values measured by ID-TIMS. The precision of Pb-206/U-238 age and Pb-207/U-235 age of the six zircons vary from 0.6% to 2.3% and 0.9% to 2.3% (2SD), respectively."
426366200043,SCIENCE,Selective targeting of engineered T cells using orthogonal IL-2 cytokine-receptor complexes,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine required for effector T cell expansion, survival, and function, especially for engineered T cells in adoptive cell immunotherapy, but its pleiotropy leads to simultaneous stimulation and suppression of immune responses as well as systemic toxicity, limiting its therapeutic use. We engineered IL-2 cytokine-receptor orthogonal (ortho) pairs that interact with one another, transmitting native IL-2 signals, but do not interact with their natural cytokine and receptor counterparts. Introduction of orthoIL-2R beta into T cells enabled the selective cellular targeting of orthoIL-2 to engineered CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo, with limited off-target effects and negligible toxicity. OrthoIL-2 pairs were efficacious in a preclinical mouse cancer model of adoptive cell therapy and may therefore represent a synthetic approach to achieving selective potentiation of engineered cells."
452677900006,PHYSICAL REVIEW C,Search for possible fusion reactions to synthesize the superheavy element Z=121,"We have studied the alpha-decay properties of superheavy nuclei Z = 121 in the range 265 <= A <= 316. A detailed study of competition between alpha decay and fission enables us to identify the possible isotopes for superheavy element Z = 121. The nuclei (299-304) 121 were found to have long half-lives and hence they could be detected if synthesized in a laboratory. After identifying the possible isotopes, we have identified the most probable projectile-target combinations by studying the fusion cross section, evaporation residue cross section, compound nucleus formation probability (P-CN), and survival probability (P-surv ) of different projectile-target combinations to synthesize the superheavy element Z = 121. The most probable projectile-target combinations to synthesize the superheavy nuclei (299-305)121 is V + Cf. The predicted alpha-decay half-lives and projectile-target combinations play a vital role in the synthesis of the superheavy element Z = 121."
439948500020,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS,Mitochondrial genome analysis in penile carcinoma,"Penile cancer is a rare neoplasm that seems to be linked to socio-economic differences. Mitochondrial genome alterations are common in many tumors types and are reported as regulating oxidative metabolism and impacting tumorigenesis. In this study, we evaluate for the first time the mitochondrial genome in penile carcinoma (PeCa), aiming to evaluate heteroplasmy, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutational load and mtDNA content in Penile tumors. Using next generation sequencing (NGS), we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of 13 penile tumors and 12 non-neoplastic tissue samples, which allowed us to identify mtDNA variants and heteroplasmy. We further evaluated variant's pathogenicity using Mutpred predictive software and calculated mtDNA content using quantitative PCR. Mitochondrial genome sequencing revealed an increase number of non-synonymous variants in the tumor tissue, along with higher frequency of heteroplasmy and mtDNA depletion in penile tumors, suggesting an increased mitochondrial instability in penile tumors. We also described a list of mitochondrial variants found in penile tumor and normal tissue, including five novel variants found in the tumoral tissue. Our results showed an increased mitochondrial genome instability in penile tumors. We also suggest that mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) and mtDNA variants may act together to imbalance mitochondrial function in PeCa. The better understanding of mitochondrial biology can bring new insights on mechanisms and open a new field for therapy in PeCa."
424509700003,ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES,Airborne remote sensing and in situ measurements of atmospheric CO2 to quantify point source emissions,"Reliable techniques to infer greenhouse gas emission rates from localised sources require accurate measurement and inversion approaches. In this study airborne remote sensing observations of CO2 by the MAMAP instrument and airborne in situ measurements are used to infer emission estimates of carbon dioxide released from a cluster of coalfired power plants. The study area is complex due to sources being located in close proximity and overlapping associated carbon dioxide plumes. For the analysis of in situ data, a mass balance approach is described and applied, whereas for the remote sensing observations an inverse Gaussian plume model is used in addition to a mass balance technique. A comparison between methods shows that results for all methods agree within 10% or better with uncertainties of 10 to 30% for cases in which in situ measurements were made for the complete vertical plume extent. The computed emissions for individual power plants are in agreement with results derived from emission factors and energy production data for the time of the overflight."
437817800001,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY,Thiamethoxam induced hepatic energy changes in silver catfish via impairment of the phosphoryl transfer network pathway: Toxicological effects on energetics homeostasis,"Precise coupling of spatially separated intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-producing and ATP-consuming processes exerts a pivotal role in bioenergetic homeostasis of living organisms, and the phosphotransfer network pathway, catalyzed by adenylate kinase (AK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), is fundamental in cellular and tissue energetic homeostasis. Measurement of the phosphotransfer network can provide new information for understanding the alterations in hepatic energetic metabolism during exposition to insecticides, such as thiamethoxam. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether exposition to thiamethoxam negatively affects the hepatic enzymes of the phosphotransfer network in silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). Hepatic AK and PK activities were inhibited at 3.75 mu g L-1 after 24 h of exposure and at 1.125 and 3.75 mu g L-1 after 96 h of exposure compared with the control group. The hepatic ATP levels were decreased following 3.75 mu g L-1 thiamethoxam treatment after 24 h of exposure and at 1.125 and 3.75 mu g(-1) after 96 h of exposure compared with the control group. The enzymatic activity of the phosphotransfer network and ATP levels did not recover after 48 h of recovery in clean water. Thus, the inhibition of hepatic AK and PK activities by thiamethoxam caused impairment of energy homeostasis in liver tissue, decreasing hepatic ATP availability. Moreover, the absence of a mutual compensatory mechanism between these enzymes directly contributes to ATP depletion and to a severe energetic dysregulation, which may contribute to toxic effects caused by thiamethoxam."

Firstly, the potato samples were soaked in different concentrations of NaCI and they were fried in sunflower oils containing different concentrations of rosemary extract. Subsequently, repeated frying was carried out with sunflower oil enriched with rosemary extract. The frying oil and the oil extracted from potato samples were analyzed in terms of the contents of 3-MCPD and glycidyl esters according to DGF C VI 18 (10) method. The results demonstrated that the content of 3-MCPD and glycidyl esters in frying oil was not significantly affected by different NaCI and rosemary extract concentrations during short term hying; however, the amount of 3-MCPD esters was found to be lower for the potato crisps enriched with rosemary extract during repeated frying cycles."
430594300001,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING,Spectral Reflectance Estimation Using Gaussian Processes and Combination Kernels,"This paper explores hyperspectral reflectance factor estimation using Gaussian process regression with multispectral- and trichromatic measurements. Estimations are performed in visible-(400-700 nm) or visible-near infrared (400-980 nm) wavelength ranges using the learning-based approach, where sensor and light spectral characteristics are not required. We first construct new estimation models via Gaussian processes, show connection to previous kernel-based models, and then evaluate new models by using marginal likelihood optimization within the probabilistic interpretation. By using standard spectral ensembles and several images in experiments, we evaluate new models with anisotropic radial-and combination kernels (process covariance), marginal likelihood optimization (parameter selection), as well as with input data transformations (pre-processing). Several new Gaussian process models provide spectral accuracy improvements for simulated and real data, when compared with the previous kernel-based models. Most versatile new model is using spectral subspace coordinate learning and combination kernels, and can be efficiently optimized via marginal likelihood. Preliminary results suggest that new models provide uncertainty estimates, which can be used for iterative training set augmentation."

Here, we present a case of a young woman carrying twins and hospitalised for acute abdominal pain. Workup for her pain revealed non-viable fetal tissue positioned in the uterine horn; the remaining fetus was viable. Initial attempts to control the patient's pain with strong parenteral opioids by the obstetrics team and the acute pain service failed. The PC service was consulted to assist. Applying a customary interdisciplinary approach in a novel PC clinical setting, the PC service was able to identify and attend to the patient's physical, psychosocial and spiritual pain, resulting in an overall decrease in reported pain scores, decreased opioid requirement and a plan for preservation of the viable fetus."
419896200018,INFLAMMATION,Acute Lung Injury in Response to Intratracheal Instillation of Lipopolysaccharide in an Animal Model of Emphysema Induced by Elastase,"The response of lungs with emphysema to an acute lung injury (ALI) remains unclear. This study compared the lung response to intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats with and without emphysema. Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomized to four groups: control group (C-G), ALI group (ALI-G), emphysema group (E-G), emphysema and ALI group (E-ALI-G). Euthanasia and the following analysis were performed 24 h after ALI induction: lung histology, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators, and blood gas measures. The histological analysis showed that animals of ALI-G (0.55 +/- 0.15) and E-ALI-G (0.69 +/- 0.08) had a higher ALI score compared to C-G (0.12 +/- 0.04) and E-G (0.16 +/- 0.04) (p < 0.05). The analysis of each component of the score demonstrated that ALI-G and E-ALI-G had greater alveolar and interstitial neutrophil infiltration, as well as greater amount of alveolar proteinaceous debris. Comparing the two groups that received LPS, there was a trend of higher ALI in the E-ALI-G, specially due to a higher neutrophil infiltration in the alveolar spaces and a higher septal thickening. Total cell count (E-G = 3.09 +/- 0.83; ALI-G = 4.45 +/- 1.9; E-ALI-G = 5.9 +/- 2.1; C-G = 0.73 +/- 0.37 x 10(5)) and neutrophil count (E-G = 0.69 +/- 0.35; ALI-G = 2.53 +/- 1.09; E-ALI-G = 3.86 +/- 1.4; C-G = 0.09 +/- 0.07 x 10(5)) in the BAL were higher in the groups E-G, ALI-G, and E-ALI-G when compared to C-G (p < 0.05). The IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CXCL2 mRNA expressions were higher in the animals that received LPS (ALI-G and E-ALI-G) compared to the C-G and E-G (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the BAL cellularity and in the expression of inflammatory mediators between the ALI-G and the E-ALI-G. The severity of ALI in response to intratracheal instillation of LPS did not show difference in rats with and without intratracheal-induced emphysema."
425680000003,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,Integrating ethnophytopathological knowledge and field surveys to improve tomato disease management in Tanzania,"The prevalence of tomato diseases and local smallholder farmer knowledge was assessed in five villages in the Morogoro Region of Tanzania during the rainy and dry production seasons. The most commonly occurring foliar diseases in both seasons were early blight (88 of 100 fields), bacterial spot/speck (49), viral diseases (42) and Septoria leaf spot (34). Bacterial spot/speck, tomato yellow leaf curl virus, other viral diseases, and late blight were present in significantly higher numbers of fields during the rainy season than the dry season, while significantly more plants per field were affected by early blight in the rainy season than the dry season. A root health assay was conducted to assess root knot nematode damage and root rot severity, and root knot nematodes were found in 44 of 50 fields surveyed. Farmers used local names for plant diseases, which tended to be associated with the symptomatology of the disease, concepts borrowed from other aspects of life, perceived causal agent or weather conditions. Identification of local names improved communication between farmers and researchers and elucidated how farmers perceived key diseases in the region. Extension materials were developed to improve farmers' identification and management of key tomato diseases in the region. Farmers can better allocate limited resources to manage key diseases through an improved understanding of prevalent diseases and local plant disease knowledge. This study serves as an example of how plant pathologists can develop a baseline understanding of key regional plant disease constraints through the integration of field surveys and ethnophytopathological studies."
453934500006,CIRCULATION-HEART FAILURE,Current Use of Hearts From Hepatitis C Viremic Donors A United Network for Organ Sharing Registry Analysis,"Background: Strategies to improve donor heart utilization are required in the setting of limited donor availability. One innovative strategy is to consider the use of hepatitis C viremic (HCV) nucleic acid amplification test positive donors in hepatitis C-negative recipients, given the availability of highly effective direct acting antiviral agents. We utilized United Network for Organ Sharing data to evaluate the geographic distribution, clinical characteristics, and post-transplant outcomes of HCV+ donor hearts. Methods and Results: The United Network for Organ Sharing registry was queried for all HCV+ recovered donors and those considered for heart donation classified by sex, age group, United Network for Organ Sharing region, and cause of death from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017. Propensity score matching (3:1) was applied to the recipients based on the index for mortality prediction after cardiac transplantation score and donor risk index. A total of 1306 HCV+ donors were recovered from 2014 to 2017 of whom 1078 (82.5%) were 18 to 49 and predominantly from the Appalachia region (United Network for Organ Sharing regions 2, 3, and 11). A total of 64 (5%) HCV+ donor hearts were transplanted in this interval. The match-adjusted risk difference in survival was estimated to be 0.87% (P=0.83) at 12 months. Conclusions: To meet the demands of heart transplantation, we must consider additional strategies to expand the donor pool. From 2014 to 2017, despite availability of highly effective direct acting antiviral therapy, only 5% of HCV+ donor hearts were accepted for transplantation. National efforts may be required to capitalize on this resource while we continue to carefully monitor the safety of this novel approach."

Firstly, we use the improved SPH method to model the non-Newtonian fluid. Secondly, the density of boundary particle is created into the calculation of fluid-solid interaction forces. Besides, we apply friction conditions to constrain the fluid particles at the boundary. Finally, we apply the predictive-corrective scheme to correct the density deviation and improve boundary computing efficiency. The experiment confirms the feasibility for the interaction between non-Newtonian fluid and solid objects with this method. At the same time, it reflects the viscous characteristics and ensures the physical properties of non-Newtonian fluid. In addition, compared to existing methods, this method is more stable and easier to implement."

443443000059,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,"Data availability, reusability, and analytic reproducibility: evaluating the impact of a mandatory open data policy at the journal Cognition","Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data ('analytic reproducibility'). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25% pre-policy to 136/ 174, 78% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/ 104, 22% pre-policy to 85/136, 62%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings."

China Phys. Mech. Astron. 60(9), 090312, 2017). However, this protocol is only workable over an ideal quantum channel. In this paper, we take the collective noise channel into account and generalize Ye and Ji's protocol into the ones against the collective-dephasing noise and the collective-rotation noise, respectively. Concretely, we use three-qubit entangled states instead of Bell states as the initial quantum states and employ the corresponding logical qubits immune to the collective noise instead of the physical qubits as the travelling particles. The output correctness and the security of the proposed robust MQPC protocols can be guaranteed."

449783400010,URBAN WATER JOURNAL,The nexus of inhabitants and impervious surfaces at city scale - wastewater and stormwater travel time distributions and an approach to calibrate diurnal variations,"We present an approach to calibrate dry weather flow patterns of people in eight subnetworks of Dresden, Germany. The monitored data was pre-processed, and SWMM model runs were performed. Congruence of modelled results and observed data was evaluated with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). New diurnal variation patterns of dry weather flow were quantified based on the presented calibration approach. Most of the modelled hydrographs exceeded an NSE of 0.9 just after the second SWMM model run, which is a sign of model adequacy. Travel time distributions (TTDs) of upstream wastewater from connected people and stormwater from impervious surfaces of the monitored locations were determined, and a dynamic index f(iA-PE)(k) was proposed, determined and its adequacy was assessed. In general, TTDs confirmed a lower population density and a less meshed urban drainage network in the outer parts of Dresden. The functional information within f(iA-PE)(k) considers development characteristics among the subnetworks and within a subnetwork of interest. The presented index is useful to evaluate prospective strategies of developments and the implementation of green and blue infrastructures in residential areas."
427100300019,BIOMATERIALS,Harnessing macrophage-mediated degradation of gelatin microspheres for spatiotemporal control of BMP2 release,"Biomaterials-based approaches to harnessing the immune and inflammatory responses to potentiate wound healing hold important promise. Bone fracture healing is characterized by an acute inflammatory phase, followed by a transition to a regenerative and repair phase. In this study, we developed genipin-crosslinked gelatin microspheres designed to be preferentially degraded by inflammatory (M1) macrophages. Highly crosslinked (>90%) microspheres allowed efficient incorporation of bioactive bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), a potent stimulator of osteogenesis in progenitor cells, via electrostatic interactions. Release of BMP2 was directly correlated with degradation of the gelatin matrix. Exposure of microspheres to polarized murine macrophages showed that degradation was significantly higher in the presence of M1 macrophages, relative to alternatively activated (M2) macrophages and unpolarized controls. Microsphere degradation in the presence of non-inflammatory cells resulted in very low degradation rates. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) by macrophages were consistent with the observed phenotype-dependent degradation rates. Indirect co-culture of BMP2-loaded microspheres and macrophages with isolated adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) showed that Ml macrophages produced the strongest osteogenic response, comparable to direct supplementation of the culture medium with BMP2. Controlled release systems that are synchronized with the inflammatory response have the potential to provide better spatiotemporal control of growth factor delivery and therefore may improve the outcomes of recalcitrant wounds.

The tests were performed at impact velocities of 4, 6. and 9 mls under two impact angles of 40 deg and 90 deg. Polarization technique was used to study corrosion behavior of the material during erosion-corrosion. The eroded .surfaces were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a surface profilometer. The pure erosion, corrosion, and erosion-corrosion rates increased as impact velocity and sand concentration increased. The corrosion rates of the eroding surfaces under a normal impact were lower than those at an impact angle of 40 deg. The SIT ratio, i.e., the ratio of synergy to erosion-corrosion rates was about 80% at an impact velocity of 4 mls, which indicated the high effect of the electrochemical corrosion on the degradation of CP-Ti at low velocity. The SIT ratio decreased to 30% and 15% at the impact velocities of 6 and 9 mls, respectively. The SIT ratio was also decreased with increasing sand concentration indicating a greater role of mechanical degradation upon the erosion-corrosion rate in the concentrated slurries."
446139200003,PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS,Dynamics in glassy polymers: The Eyring model revisited,"Applying a stress to a glassy polymer accelerates its dynamics as one goes from low stress up to plastic regime. For decades, the phenomenological Eyring's model has been used to describe plastic flow in polymers. This model, however, raises fundamental issues which makes its use deleterious in glassy polymers. We propose an alternative model in which the elastic energy stored at the length scale of dynamical heterogeneities xi approximate to 3-5 nm reduces the free energy barrier for relaxation. Contrary to the Eyring's activation volume, which has no clear interpretation, this length scale is derived from physical arguments, based on a detailed account of relaxation mechanisms at the molecular scale. Recent creep experiments in glassy polymers by Ediger and coworkers allow for discriminating the two pictures. It is shown that the whole evolution of the tau(alpha) relaxation time under stress can be reproduced quantitatively, using as the only adjustable parameter the scale xi. The obtained value of xi is the same as the value previously determined by considering the whole set of properties of glassy polymers. This confirms the coherence and completeness of the theory of relaxation processes in nonpolar glassy polymers that we proposed in previous works."
428131200004,ULTRAMICROSCOPY,Ewald sphere correction using a single side-band image processing algorithm,"Curvature of the Ewald sphere limits the resolution at which Fourier components in an image can be approximated as corresponding to a projection of the object. Since the radius of the Ewald sphere is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the imaging electrons, this normally imposes a limit on the thickness of specimen for which images can be easily interpreted to a particular resolution. Here we present a computational method for precisely correcting for the curvature of the Ewald sphere using defocused images that delocalise the high-resolution Fourier components from the primary image. By correcting for each approximately Friedel-symmetry-related sideband separately using two distinct complex transforms that effectively move the displaced Fourier components back to where they belong in the structure, we can determine the amplitude and phase of each of the Fourier components separately. This precisely accounts for the effect of Ewald sphere curvature over a bandwidth defined by the defocus and the size of the particle being imaged. We demonstrate this processing algorithm using: 1. simulated images of a particle with only a single, high-resolution Fourier component, and 2. experimental images of gold nanoparticles embedded in ice. Processing micrographs with this algorithm will allow higher resolution imaging of thicker specimens at lower energies without any image degradation or blurring due to errors made by the assumption of a flat Ewald sphere. Although the procedure will work best on images recorded with higher defocus settings than used normally, it should still improve 3D single-particle structure determination using images recorded at any defocus and any electron energy. Finally, since the Ewald sphere curvature is in a known direction in the third dimension which is parallel to the direction of view, this algorithm automatically determines the absolute hand of the specimen without the need for pairs of images with a known tilt angle difference.

Methodology: This was a cross-sectional epidemiological study with secondary data source of 3 CEO-R, from which 237 medical records of complete orthodontic treatments were examined, with 8.283 appointments and 2.665 (32.17%) missing appointments. Data collection was standardized by an electronic questionnaire.. Factors associated with users missing appointments were calculated by means of absence rates and thematic maps were constructed based on distributions of the geographical pattern of occurrence. To evaluate the association between the outcome variable (absence from treatment) and the independent variables (sex, age, breakage of appliance, change of professional, income and place of user's residence) multiple logistic regression analysis was used with p <= 0.05. Results: There were high absence rates for both city headquarters and non-headquarter CEO-Rs. The variable change of professional showed statistical significance, in relation to the number of absences. Conclusion: The highest number of absences was associated with change of professional."
447577600001,POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY,"Contagious Republicanism in Louisiana, 1966-2014","In this paper, we build on prior work by Hood, Kidd, and Morris (2012), who show that growth in Republican identification in Southern states since 1965 rose in response to black mobilization. In their theory of relative advantage, as more African-Americans registered with the Democratic Party, white voters could maintain the same intraparty status by moving to the sparser-populated Republican Party. In this project, we focus on Louisiana and how the state's local-level politics created the opportunity for partisan contagion among parishes for organizational, electoral, and mobilization reasons. We show that, beyond the factors known to contribute to a rise in Republican identification in the South, whenever a parish in Louisiana became more Republican, there were spillover effects in neighboring parishes. Hence, as one parish became more Republican, neighboring parishes followed suit. We also show that as the extraction of natural resources such as oil and natural gas rose, a parish was more inclined to become more Republican."
423248100028,FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY,Benefit and risk assessment of increasing potassium intake by replacement of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in industrial food products in Norway,"High sodium chloride (NaCl) intake is associated with health risks. NaCl may be replaced by potassium chloride (KCl) to decrease sodium intake. However, increased potassium may also have negative health effects. We conducted a benefit and risk assessment of increasing potassium by ratios of 30:70, 50:50, 70:30 (weight %K+: weight % Na+) in children, adolescents and adults in Norway, using intake data from national food consumption surveys and available literature on potassium health effects. An intake of at least 3.5 g/day of potassium decreases risk of stroke and hypertension, and this level was used in the benefit assessment of the healthy population. Three g/day of potassium added to mean food intake is assumed safe, and these levels were used in the risk assessment. Not all persons reached the protective level of potassium, and increasing numbers exceeded the safe levels, in these scenarios. In addition, elderly above 85 years and infants below one year of age, as well as several patient groups and medication users, are particularly vulnerable to hyperkalemia. In conclusion, the number of Norwegians facing increased risk is far greater than the number likely to benefit from this replacement of sodium with potassium in industrially produced food."
425947800074,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,An approach to predict derivative-chip formation in derivative cutting of micro-textured tools,"Derivative cutting of micro-textured tool refers to the additional cutting to the bottom side of the chip with the micro-surface textures on the tool surface. In our previous research, it has been proved that piling up of chip in the microgroove of textures is caused by derivative cutting, resulting in structural function failure of the textured tool face. Hence, derivative-cutting behavior needs to be understood and implemented in models. In this study, an analytical approach for the orthogonal cutting process is developed to determinate derivative-chip formation by predictions of the uncut derivative-chip thickness (UDCT) and minimum uncut derivative-chip thickness (MUDCT) values according to cutting parameters, tool geometry, workpiece material properties, and positional and geometrical parameters of textures. The analytical approach is experimentally validated using a 1045 steel workpiece with the textures of different distances to the main cutting edge on the tool rake face. Subsequently, the responses of the UDCT and MUDCT to cutting speed and texture parameters including its geometry and position are quantified on the basis of the proposed approach. Results show that reasonable enlarging of texture-edge radius and proper increasing of cutting speed both are feasible ways to prevent derivative-cutting from derivative-chip formation."

427881200008,ECOTOXICOLOGY,Differential expression of the PAL gene family in rice seedlings exposed to chromium by microarray analysis,"Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is one of the principle enzymes involved in plant's secondary metabolism. Expression of individual isogene from the PAL gene family is variable with species of plants in responses to different stresses. In this study, transcriptome analysis of the PAL gene family in rice seedlings exposed to potassium chromate Cr(VI) or chromium nitrate Cr(III) was conducted using Agilent 44K rice microarray and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Uptake and accumulation of both Cr species by rice seedlings and their effect on PAL activity were also determined. Three days of Cr exposure led to significant accumulation of Cr in plant tissues, but majority being in roots rather than shoots. Changes of PAL activities in rice tissues were evident from both Cr treatments. Individual isogene from the rice PAL gene family was expressed differentially in response to both Cr variants. Comparing gene expression between two Cr treatments, only osPAL2 and osPAL4 genes were expressed in similar patterns. Also, gene expression pattern was inconsistent in both plant tissues. Results indicated that expression of individual isoform from the rice PAL gene family is tissue, and stimulus specific under different Cr exposure, suggesting their different detoxification strategies for decreasing or eliminating Cr stresses."
436403900010,CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPTOMETRY,Eye care in young children: a parent survey exploring access and barriers,"BackgroundA questionnaire was designed to investigate the attitudes of parents toward eye care for their young children (4-6-year-olds) and possible barriers to accessing eye care for this age group. An exploration was undertaken to determine whether these beliefs and barriers are influenced by certain demographic factors such as ethnicity, level of parental income, level of parental education, confidence with speaking English and a reported family history of eye problems. MethodsA total of 1,317 questionnaires (hard copies) were distributed to parents of children in primary school reception and year one classes (ages four to six) from 14 schools across five London boroughs. Ninety online surveys were sent to parents at two further London schools. All questionnaires were anonymous. ResultsA total of 384 completed questionnaires were analysed (27 per cent response rate). Three hundred and thirty-eight parents (24 per cent) completed the parental knowledge' section of the questionnaire. Of all responses, 65 per cent (n=249) were from parents whose children attended a school where a program of school entry vision screening took place. Of these, 15 per cent (n=36) of parents reported that they were aware of the screening program. Barriers to accessing eye care for their children were reported by 38 per cent (n=153) of parents/carers who responded. Twelve per cent (n=47) reported not knowing how to access an eye test for their child and 12 per cent (n=47) reported that they were concerned their child would be given glasses that were not needed. When compared to parents from White ethnic groups, parents from African/Afro-Caribbean ethnic groups were more likely to report not knowing how to access an age-appropriate eye test for their child (p=0.001). Parents of African/Afro-Caribbean ethnic origins were statistically more likely to report barriers to eye care (p=0.001). ConclusionThe study provides evidence of some parental misconceptions around eye care for young children and some barriers to access. Possible solutions to this are discussed."

The electron energy levels were studied by UV-vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry methods. The measurement results indicate that the CoPcF16 compound embodies suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level for electron injection. Thermal analysis shows that the compound has excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature above 537 degrees C. The CoPcF16 thin film was characterized by XRD and AFM. And the results show that CoPcF16 molecules are almost perpendicular to the substrate. These results indicate that the CoPcF16 compound is a good candidate for the application in Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) as n-type semiconductor materials.
424182600022,GENE,MiR-564 is down-regulated in osteosarcoma and inhibits the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells via targeting Akt,"Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been observed in a variety of human cancers. In this study, we reported that miR-564 was down-regulated in human osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines and patients. Overexpression of miR-564 in OS cells suppressed the cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, we identified Akt as a direct target of miR-564. Highly expressed miR-564 decreased the expression of Akt at both mRNA and protein level and consequently, inhibited the essential role of Akt in the glycolysis of OS cells. Notably, restoring the expression of Akt in miR-564 overexpressing cells recovered the glucose metabolism and cell growth. These results suggested that miR-564 inhibited the glycolysis and cell proliferation through directly targeting Akt, which highlighted the potential application of miR-564-Akt axis in the treatment of osteosarcoma."
423684600011,CRYSTENGCOMM,"Growth of an 8-hydroxyquinoline single crystal by a modified Czochralski growth technique, and crystal characterization",A novel modified Czochralski crystal growth technique for low temperature was designed with a closed chamber which allowed for variations in the environment. A large sized single crystal of 8-hydroxyquinoline with diameter 1.2 cm and length 7.4 cm was successfully grown in an argon atmosphere. Structural parameters were determined by the powder X-ray diffraction method. The functional groups were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Thermal transitions at various temperatures were measured by thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyses. The dielectric properties of the grown crystal were studied with variations of temperature and frequency. The grown crystals were found to be piezoelectric as confirmed by the d(33) coefficient of 5 pC N-1. A Vickers microhardness study revealed that the grown crystal belongs to the soft type single crystals with a Meyer's index (n) of 1.98.

The use of optimization procedures can therefore be used to quantify and minimize the uncertainties in chemical mechanisms with respect to available experimental targets in these conditions. This work puts forth a methodology that improves the performance of chemical kinetics with respect to MILD combustion. The experimental data used in this paper are from a plug flow reactor, where the ignition delay time for methane and biomass pyrolysis products in MILD conditions was analyzed. The initial mechanism was then evaluated, and the reactions with the highest impact factors were used in the optimization process. The combination of parameters that gave the lowest error with respect to the experimental data was then determined, and the proposed mechanism performance was improved with respect to the experimental targets."
444741400002,NEW YORK JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS,Sets and mappings in beta S which are not Borel,"We extend theorems proved in [1] by showing that, if S is a countably infinite left cancellative semigroup and there is a finite bound on the size of sets of the form {x is an element of S : xa = b} for a, b is an element of S, then the following subsets of beta S are not Borel: the set of idempotents, the smallest ideal, any semiprincipal right ideal defined by an element of S*, and S*S*. This has the imediate corollary that, if S is any infinite semigroup which either has the cancellation properties just described or has infinitely many cancellable elements, then the set of idempotents in beta S is not Borel. We extend a theorem proved in [1], which states that for any infinite discrete group G and any p is an element of G*, lambda(p) : beta G -> beta G is not Borel, by showing that this theorem holds for all infinite semigroups which are right cancellative and very weakly left cancellative. We show that continuous maps between compact spaces map Baire sets to universally measurable sets, although this is far from being the case for Borel sets."
424074900008,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS,Collective memories of colonialism and acculturation dynamics among Congolese immigrants living in Belgium,"Collective memories of the historical past allow group members to make sense of their shared past but also to project themselves in the present and future. In this line, collective memories of colonialism may present consequences for present day intergroup relations and acculturation dynamics, given that they allow processes of meaning making and social positioning when different groups with a shared colonial past interact. Indeed, previous research has shown that collective memories are associated with processes of reconciliation, victimization, and group based emotions, among others, but, to our knowledge, little research has paid attention to the connections between collective memories of colonialism and acculturation dynamics among groups with a past of colonization. The present study aimed to analyze collective memories of colonialism and acculturation experiences among Congolese immigrants living in Belgium. 43 semi-structured interviews with Congolese participants were content analyzed, using an analytical framework along the two variables of interest. We were able to map distinct aspects of the collective memories of colonialism that Congolese immigrants in Belgium"" have, as well as their experiences of acculturation in Belgium. Our results suggest that individuals remember their ingroup's past in accordance with their current social identifications and relationships within a given society. The results are discussed in light of their consequences for present day intergroup relations between host and immigrant communities in Belgium."
450775300048,PLOS ONE,"The impact of environmental change on Palaeolithic and Mesolithic plant use and the transition to agriculture at Franchthi Cave, Greece","The multi-period (similar to 38,000-6000 cal BP) site of Franchthi Cave, located in the Argolid peninsula of southern mainland Greece, is unique in the Eastern Mediterranean for preserving a long archaeological sequence extending from the Upper Palaeolithic through to the end of the Neolithic period. In this paper, we present new anthracological (carbonized fuel wood waste) evidence from Franchthi Cave with which we reconstruct the changing ecology of woodland vegetation in its environs during the late Pleistocene and the early-mid Holocene. The integrated archaeobotanical record (charred wood and non-wood macro-remains) demonstrates that in the Lateglacial the now-submerged coastal shelf of the southern Argolid peninsula was covered by steppe grassland vegetation dominated by junipers, almonds, cereals and legumes. The rapid climatic amelioration that marked the start of the Holocene brought about the disappearance of juniper and the expansion of deciduous woodland, cereals and lentils. This woodland-grassland biome bears no analogues in the modern and historical vegetation ecology of the Aegean basin. Instead, it is directly comparable to the steppe woodland biomes exploited by late Pleistocene and early Holocene hunter-gatherers in Southwest Asia, and points to the convergent evolution of late Pleistocene and early Holocene plant exploitation strategies between the two regions. Continuous sea-level rise during the early Holocene led to the gradual extinction of this unique palaeohabitat, which acted as the catalyst for the selective introduction of domesticated cereal crops at Franchthi Cave in the early 9th millennium cal BP. Our meta-analysis of the non-wood archaeobotanical data puts into question the concept of the wholesale introduction of a crop ""package"" by pioneer settler groups arriving from the East. It is proposed instead that selective cereal crop introduction formed part of a complex pattern of sociocultural interactions that brought together indigenous and immigrant groups into new communities."
455732100006,REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE,Reference values for the senior fitness test in Chilean older women,"Background: The Senior Fitness Test (SFT) is frequently used to assess physical fitness and functional independence in older people. Aim: To establish reference values for the SFT in Chilean physically active older women according to age ranges. Material and Methods: Cross-sectional study that included 1048 Chilean women aged between 60 and 85 years. Chair stand (CS), arm curl (AC), two-min walk (2 min), chair sit-and-reach (CSr), back scratch (BS), and timed up-and-go test (TUG) were evaluated. The reference values are presented in percentiles (p5, p10, p25, p50, p75, p90 and p95) and are distributed age intervals (60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79 and 80 years). Results: There was a decrease in strength (CS and AC), aerobic resistance (2 min) and flexibility (CSr and BS) along with age, whereas the time required to perform the timed up and go increased along with age. Conclusions: Physically active older women show a deterioration in physical fitness along with age. These women have higher reference values in CS, AC, 2 min and CSr, and lower in BS and TUG, than those reported abroad for the SFT."
444501800001,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,Audio-/Videorecording Clinic Visits for Patient's Personal Use in the United States: Cross-Sectional Survey,"Background: Few clinics in the United States routinely offer patients audio or video recordings of their clinic visits. While interest in this practice has increased, to date, there are no data on the prevalence of recording clinic visits in the United States. Objective: Our objectives were to (1) determine the prevalence of audiorecording clinic visits for patients' personal use in the United States, (2) assess the attitudes of clinicians and public toward recording, and (3) identify whether policies exist to guide recording practices in 49 of the largest health systems in the United States. Methods: We administered 2 parallel cross-sectional surveys in July 2017 to the internet panels of US-based clinicians (SERMO Panel) and the US public (Qualtrics Panel). To ensure a diverse range of perspectives, we set quotas to capture clinicians from 8 specialties. Quotas were also applied to the public survey based on US census data (gender, race, ethnicity, and language other than English spoken at home) to approximate the US adult population. We contacted 49 of the largest health systems (by clinician number) in the United States by email and telephone to determine the existence, or absence, of policies to guide audiorecordings of clinic visits for patients' personal use. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with recording. Results: In total, 456 clinicians and 524 public respondents completed the surveys. More than one-quarter of clinicians (129/456, 28.3%) reported that they had recorded a clinic visit for patients' personal use, while 18.7% (98/524) of the public reported doing so, including 2.7% (14/524) who recorded visits without the clinician's permission. Amongst clinicians who had not recorded a clinic visit, 49.5% (162/327) would be willing to do so in the future, while 66.0% (346/524) of the public would be willing to record in the future. Clinician specialty was associated with prior recording: specifically oncology (odds ratio [OR] 5.1, 95% CI 1.9-14.9; P=.002) and physical rehabilitation (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-11.6; P=.01). Public respondents who were male (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.26-3.61; P=.005), younger (OR 0.73 for a 10-year increase in age, 95% CI 0.60-0.89; P=.002), or spoke a language other than English at home (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.09-3.59; P=.02) were more likely to have recorded a clinic visit. None of the large health systems we contacted reported a dedicated policy; however, 2 of the 49 health systems did report an existing policy that would cover the recording of clinic visits for patient use. The perceived benefits of recording included improved patient understanding and recall. Privacy and medicolegal concerns were raised. Conclusions: Policy guidance from health systems and further examination of the impact of recordings-positive or negative-on care delivery, clinician-related outcomes, and patients' behavioral and health-related outcomes is urgently required."
428977200011,JACC-CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS,Conscious Sedation Versus General Anesthesia in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement The German Aortic Valve Registry,"OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to report on the use of local anesthesia or conscious sedation (LACS) and general anesthesia in transcatheter aortic valve replacement and to analyze the impact on outcome. BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve replacement can be performed in LACS or general anesthesia. Potential benefits of LACS, such as faster procedures and shorter hospital stays, need to be balanced with safety. METHODS A total of 16,543 patients from the German Aortic Valve Registry from 2011 to 2014 were analyzed, and propensity-matched analyses were performed to correct for potential selection bias. RESULTS LACS was used in 49% of patients (8,121 of 16,543). In hospital, LACS was associated with lower rates of low-output syndrome, respiratory failure, delirium, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and death. There was no difference in paravalvular leakage (IIthorn) between LACS and general anesthesia in the entire population (5% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.76) or in the matched population (3.9% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.13). The risk for prolonged intensive care unit stay (>= 3 days) was significantly reduced with LACS (odds ratio: 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73 to 0.92; p = 0.001). Thirty-day mortality was lower with LACS in the entire population (3.5% vs. 4.9%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.86; p < 0.001) and in the matched population (2.8% vs. 4.6%; HR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.8; p < 0.001). However, no differences in 1-year mortality between both groups in the entire population (16.5% vs. 16.9%; HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.02; p = 0.140) and in the propensity-matched population (14.1% vs. 15.5%; HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.03; p = 0.130) were observed. CONCLUSIONS Use of LACS in transcatheter aortic valve replacement is safe, with fewer post-procedural complications and lower early mortality, suggesting its broad application.

425619400015,JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES,Performance of Precast Concrete Substructures with Dry Connections to Resist Progressive Collapse,"In the current study, three one-third scaled beam-slab substructures comprising a cast-in-place reinforced concrete specimen and two precast concrete (PC) specimens were tested under a pushdown loading regime to investigate the effects of connection types on the behavior of PC structures to mitigate progressive collapse. A special link was designed to enhance the connection between PC slabs and PC beams. The test results, including load-displacement curves, ultimate load capacity, ultimate deformation capacity, and local strains, are presented. The failure mode and mechanisms of load redistribution are further discussed. It is demonstrated that the PC specimen with welded connections achieved brittle failure with the lowest ultimate load capacity and deformation capacity. Although the lowest initial stiffness and first peak load capacity were achieved in the PC specimen with pinned connections, its large rotational ability ensured that the specimen failed in a ductile manner, which allowed the development of considerable tensile membrane actions. The main source of the membrane action was from the reinforcement mesh in the topping layer. Despite severe separations occurring between the PC slabs and beams, no PC slab collapsed even though the maximum displacement was larger than double the beam span.

426049500094,PLOS ONE,Where is the left ventricle during cardiopulmonary resuscitation based on chest computed tomography in the expiration with arms down position?,"Objective Patients usually receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation during ventilatory expiration and with their arms down, which does not reflect the normal imaging position. This study used scout images from low-dose chest computed tomography to compare the locations of the left ventricle (LV) in the expiration with arms down position (EAD) and in the full inspirational with arms raised position (IAR). Methods This cross-sectional study used a convenience sample and evaluated scout images that were obtained during screening with the participants in the EAD and IAR positions. The effective compression point was defined as being on the sternum above the longest anteroposterior diameter (APD) of the LV (using axial computed tomography images). The sternum was divided into three parts and the heart's position was evaluated on the EAD and the IAR images, and the distance from the xiphoid process to the LV's sternum landmark (XLVD) was measured. We also examined the compressible organs during CPR based on the EAD and IAR images. Results We enrolled 127 participants. The LVs were located in the middle of the sternum at EAD for 117 participants (92%) and in the lower half of the sternum at IAR for 107 participants (84%). The mean XLVD was significantly different between the EAD and IAR positions (mean: 85 +/- 21 mm vs. 33 +/- 17 mm, respectively). The liver's left lobe was located in the lower half of the sternum at EAD for 118 participants (93%). Conclusions These findings indicate that the location of the LV during cardiopulmonary resuscitation might be in the middle of the sternum if the patient is treated in the EAD position."
432095700008,JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL,Dynamic response of a front end accessory drive system and parameter optimization for vibration reduction via a genetic algorithm,"A typical engine front end accessory drive system (FEADS) is mathematically modeled through Hamilton's principle and Newton's second law. In this model, the belt's flexural rigidity and pulley's eccentricity are considered. Eccentricities of the pulleys are introduced into governing motion equations of the belt spans through the boundary conditions and then transformed to external forces acting on the belt spans. Vibration modes and natural frequencies of the FEADS are calculated by the state-space technique of the complex mode theory. Dynamic responses of the FEADS at different rotational rates of the crankshaft are calculated by solving the spatially discretized governing equations obtained by Galerkin method. The modeling and solution methods are formulated and programmed in a general purposed code. The study shows that the typical resonance and beat phenomenon happen in a certain portion of the belt spans at a certain rotational rate by the excitations of the pulley's eccentricity. According to the modal analysis and dynamic response analysis, an optimization method based on a genetic algorithm is proposed. By comparing the vibration amplitudes of belt spans before and after optimization at different rotational rates, this optimization method is verified to be effective in reducing transverse vibrations of the belt spans."
454244600064,ACS OMEGA,Thermographic Detection and Analysis of the Temporal and Spatial Evolution of Temperature upon Optical Heating of Gold Nanorod Assembly Immobilized in Agar,"Photoexcitation of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance band of gold nanorods (AuNRs) in the near-infrared region has been widely employed in photothermal therapy. Generally, the temperature evolution of the surface of the object of interest reflects the photothermal efficiency. However, the temperature in the object interior may be higher than required and cause unwanted damage to the healthy cells or tissues in the vicinity of the unhealthy areas. In this work, agar served as a biomimicking tissue, and 1 mm(3) AuNR agar assembly cubes were placed at different depths with respect to the agar surface and excited with an 808 nm continuous-wave laser or an 850 nm light-emitting diode light. The evolution of the surface temperature was monitored with an infrared thermographic camera and analyzed with a point heat source model. The concentric temperature change suggested that the sample was nonfluidic and that convection and mass flow could be excluded. The depths of the AuNR agar cubes could be determined and were consistent with the prepared depths. Thus, using the agar matrix and AuNRs with optical heating and monitoring, in combination with the point heat source model, is feasible for the analysis of the surface and interior temperature evolutions of the object and the further determination of the initial conditions of systems, such as the positions of the heat source, the injection power, and so on."
419096800010,ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE,"The impacts of dietary Nigella sativa meal and Avizyme on growth, nutrient digestibility and blood metabolites of meat-type quail","The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of varying proportion of Nigella sativa meal (NSM) in the diets with or without Avizyme supplementation on growing Japanese quail performance. A 4 x 2 factorial experiment was conducted including four levels of NSM (0%, 10%, 15% and 20% of the diet) and two levels of dietary Avizyme supplementation (0 or 0.5 g/kg diet) through the growing period (1-6 weeks of age). A total number of 600 unsexed 1-week-old Japanese quail chicks were randomly distributed into eight treatment groups. The effects of NSM inclusion levels were highly significant (P < 0.01) on the values of live bodyweight, daily bodyweight gain and daily feed intake at all periods studied. The incorporation of 10% NSM of the diet recorded the best values of live bodyweight and daily bodyweight gain compared with the Control and other NSM levels. Quail fed diets contained 10% or 15% NSM had higher (P < 0.01) daily feed intake than those in the Control, but feed conversion ratio was not statistically affected at all studied ages. All carcass traits studied were significantly (P < 0.01) affected by feeding the NSM diet. The digestion coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, ether extract and nitrogen-free extract were significantly (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) increased in chicks fed diets containing 10% NSM as compared with the Control. Quail fed diets including 10% or 15% NSM had increased serum concentrations of total protein, albumin and a higher A: G ratio. All serum lipid constituents except high density lipoprotein were at lower (P < 0.01) concentrations in blood serum of quail fed diets containing NSM. Using NSM at level of 20% of the diet had a negative impact on growth, carcass characteristics, and nutrient digestibility. Neither Avizyme supplementation alone nor the interaction between NSM and Avizyme had any statistically impact on all studied parameters. It can be concluded that NSM could be included in growing quail diets up to 15% without any Avizyme supplementation to support growth performance and feed utilisation, however higher NSM levels negatively affected performance, carcass traits and nutrient digestibility."

I argue the hashtag's creators strategically mobilized #Twinks4Trump during Donald Trump's presidential campaign to produce a networked site of identification wherein rearticulated queer vernacular rhetorics, specifically the daddy/twink dichotomy, functioned as toxic tropes in the promotion of a homonationalist agenda. A Freudian-inflected examination of Instagram posts produced by the two most prominent figures of the movement offers an understanding of the ways the affordances of social media culture enable the forging of a toxic identification based in the subject's impossible desire to return to the purified interiority of a racialized pre-Oedipal state."
423642500014,SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH,Extract of Moringa oleifera leaves improves feed utilization of lactating Nubian goats,"The present experiment aimed to assess the effect of providing oral doses of Moringa oleifera leaf extract on feed intake, nutrient digestion, and ruminal and blood serum measurements in goats. Sixteen lactating Nubian does (36.5 +/- 0.6 kg) were used in a quadruplicated 4 x 4 Latin square design over an 88-day period. An aqueous M. oleifera extract was supplemented orally to each doe at doses of 0 (Control treatment), 10 (ME10 treatment), 20 (ME20 treatment) or 40 mL (ME40 treatment). Compared with control, M. oleifera extract linearly increased (P < 0.01) nutrient intake and digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and neutral detergent fiber, without affecting digestibility of crude protein and ether extract. Without affecting ruminal pH and ammonia-N, M. oleifera extract increased (P < 0.05) total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), branched-chain SCFA, and propionic acid concentrations; however, the extract linearly decreased (P < 0.01) acetic/propionic ratio and calculated methane production. Increased (P < 0.01) serum albumin and glucose concentrations, and decreased (P < 0.05) cholesterol, triglycerides, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase concentrations were noted with the inclusion of M. oleifera extract. It is concluded that an oral dose of M. oleifera extract enhanced feed intake and digestibility and ruminal fermentation in lactating Nubian does. Although further research is needed, performance responses associated with increasing the dose of M. oleifera extract to 40 mL/doe were not large; thus, the 20 mL dose is recommended for practical use."
425734200008,INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL,Anal sphincter injury in vaginal deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia,"Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency that occurs in 0.2-3% of all cephalic vaginal deliveries. We hypothesized that because of the difficult nature of deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia, the condition may be associated with anal sphincter injury. We sought to identify risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter injury in women with shoulder dystocia. This retrospective analysis included all cases of shoulder dystocia from 2007 to 2011 at two large tertiary referral centers, in the USA and Ireland. Details of maternal demographics, intrapartum characteristics, and delivery outcomes in cases of shoulder dystocia were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to describe the association between shoulder dystocia and anal sphincter injury. There were 685 cases of shoulder dystocia, and the rate of shoulder dystocia was similar at both institutions. The incidence of anal sphincter injury was 8.8% (60 out of 685). The rate was 14% (45 out of 324) in nulliparas and 4.2% (15 out of 361) in multiparas. Women with sphincter injury were more likely to be nulliparous (75% [45 out of 60] vs 45% [279 out of 625]; p < 0.0001), have had an operative vaginal delivery (50% [30 out of 60] vs 36% [226 out of 625]; p = 0.03) and require internal maneuvers (50% [30 out of 60] vs 32% [198 out of 625], p = 0.004) than those with an intact sphincter. On multivariate regression analysis, these predictors of sphincter injury remained significant when adjusted for other risk factors. Episiotomy was negatively associated with sphincter injury on multivariate regression analysis. In a retrospective cohort of 685 women with shoulder dystocia, the risk of anal sphincter injury is 9%. Risk factors include nulliparity, operative vaginal delivery, and use of internal maneuvers, whereas episiotomy was found to have a protective effect against anal sphincter injury during cases of shoulder dystocia."
457205900001,MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS,Patella tracking calculation from patellofemoral positions at finite angles of knee flexion,"Patellofemoral (PF) pain is a common knee disease. Patella tracking has a significant correlation with PF pain, therefore it could be used as an index for diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Previous research has proposed a method for measuring in vivo patella tracking by means of an interpolation algorithm. The present study aimed to quantify the effect of the interpolation parameters on the accuracy of the patella tracking with a motion capture experiment. The precise patella tracking of 5 knee specimens was collected and compared with the interpolated tracking. The results showed that the total interpolation error decreased to 2 mm with the number of interpolation angles increasing to 6. The number of interpolation reference points had a slight influence on the accuracy. The findings consolidated the feasibility of using interpolation to measure the in vivo patella tracking, and can help to optimize the accuracy and efficiency of the methodology. (C) 2018 IPEM.

452344400033,INORGANIC CHEMISTRY,Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties of Uranium Hydride UH2 Stabilized as a Thin Film,"A new type of uranium binary hydride, UH2, with the CaF2 crystal structure, was synthesized in a thin-film form using reactive sputter deposition at low temperatures. The material has a grain size of 50-100 nm. The lattice parameter a = (535.98 +/- 0.14 pm) is close to that in known Np (534.3 pm) and Pu (535.9 pm) iso-types. UH2 is a metallic ferromagnet with the Curie temperature T-C approximate to 120 K. A very wide hysteresis loop indicates strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals similarities with electronic structure of UH3, which is also ferromagnet with higher T-C = 165 K."
452966400001,BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,Effects of Diet-Induced Obesity and Deficient in Vitamin D on Spermatozoa Function and DNA Integrity in Sprague-Dawley Rats,"Obesity has adverse effects on male fertility and usually is diagnosed with a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VD-). Discussion on the impact of obesity/VD- on sperm function has been limited. This study analyzed the effects of diet-induced obesity/VD- on viability and plasmamembrane integrity (PMI), superoxide anion (O-2(-)) level, and DNA fragmentation (DNA(frag)) in sperm Sprague-Dawley rats. The males were randomized into four groups and fed for a period of 12 weeks: G1: control diet with vitamin D(C/VD+), G2: control diet without vitamin D (C/VD-), G3: high-fat diet with vitamin D (HF/VD+), and G4: high-fat diet without vitamin D (HF/VD-). Sperm function parameters were analyzed by flow cytometry. PMI percentages and O-2(-) levels were not affected by any of the diets. DNA fragmentation was increasing significantly (p<0.05) in the spermatozoa of animals with diets vitamin D deficient (G2) and diet-induced obesity (G4). Our results allow us to point out that diet-induced obesity and VD- produce greater damage in DNA sperm of rats. The use of nutraceuticals containing vitamin D could be reducing the risk of fragmentation of DNA in spermatozoa."
445895400018,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Cooperation in the spatial prisoner's dilemma game with probabilistic abstention,"Research has shown that the addition of abstention as an option transforms social dilemmas to rock-paper-scissor type games, where defectors dominate cooperators, cooperators dominate abstainers (loners), and abstainers (loners), in turn, dominate defectors. In this way, abstention can sustain cooperation even under adverse conditions, although defection also persists due to cyclic dominance. However, to abstain or to act as a loner has, to date, always been considered as an independent, third strategy to complement traditional cooperation and defection. Here we consider probabilistic abstention, where each player is assigned a probability to abstain in a particular instance of the game. In the two limiting cases, the studied game reverts to the prisoner's dilemma game without loners or to the optional prisoner's dilemma game. For intermediate probabilities, we have a new hybrid game, which turns out to be most favorable for the successful evolution of cooperation. We hope this novel hybrid game provides a more realistic view of the dilemma of optional/voluntary participation."
451272500016,JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A,Low damage patterning of In0.53Ga0.47As film for its integration as n-channel in a fin metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor architecture,"One of the challenges of InGaAs integration as a channel in a fin field effect transistor architecture is the patterning of the III-V fin with nanometer scale definition, vertical sidewalls, and undamaged surfaces. In this work, the authors propose a two-step process to etch anisotropically and with minimal damage thin layers of InGaAs material. The first step of the process aims to modify the InGaAs surface on a well-defined thickness with limited sputtering by implanting light ions generated by a low pressure He/O-2 plasma. The depth of the material modification is well controlled by the ion energy and saturates with process time, giving to this step a self-limited behavior. The second step uses aqueous HF solution to remove the modified oxidized InGaAs layer with infinite selectivity over the nonmodified InGaAs layer. The repetition of cycles of the two-step process was applied to etch the thin film of InGaAs as well as pattern using a SiN hard mask. Blanket experiments show that each cycle of the two-step process allows to remove a fixed and reproducible InGaAs thickness of 5.7 nm, while blanket SiN films are not consumed. After the process, the InGaAs surface roughness is kept intact, but the surface stoichiometry is slightly degraded with Arsenic enrichment because of the wet chemical reactions between the III-As semiconductors and the acids. The results on the pattern show that it is possible to transfer the SiN hard mask into the InGaAs layer using cycles of the two-step process with a reproducible consumed InGaAs thickness at each cycle and low sidewalls surface damage. However, the process leads to tapered InGaAs profile because of the lateral consumption of the SiN hard mask due to preferential sputtering at grazing incidence angle. Published by the AVS."
444664400036,COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING,A route-based network simulation framework for airport ground system disruptions,"Every year, delayed, cancelled, or diverted flights cost airports significant man-hours and millions of dollars all over the world. The Airlines for America reported that the total direct aircraft operating cost per block minute was $62.55 in 2016, and at this rate, delay minutes cost more than $7 billion in aircraft operations for scheduled US passenger airlines only. Keeping flights on schedule only becomes more difficult with today's ever increasing demand for air transportation and disruptive events including natural and human-caused hazards. In this study, we analyze the adversarial impact of such disruptive events on an airport ground system using a route-based network simulation framework (RuNSim). Aiming to increase an airport's ability to take quick, responsive actions against disruptions leading to flight delays and cancellations, RuNSim is comprised of four modules: (1) pre-processing, (2) runway simulation, (3) route-based taxiway simulation, and (4) apron simulation. Our proposed framework incorporates technical as well as regulatory constraints for safety and system uncertainties. The capabilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated through two different case studies based on real data obtained from the LaGuardia Airport ground system. In these case studies, two disruptive events, namely taxiway pavement network damage and runway closure, are investigated in terms of their impact on taxi-in and taxi-out times. Conclusions are drawn on the adverse impacts of these events on the airport ground network along with available actions to minimize such flight delays under these events."
436900200003,ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY,The knockdown of the mediator complex subunit MED30 suppresses the proliferation and migration of renal cell carcinoma cells,"Background: The mediator complex consists of 33 subunits and plays a central role in transcription. Studies have already described the involvement of individual subunits, especially in carcinogenesis. With regard to the subunit MED30, this has, so far, only been confirmed in gastric and breast carcinoma. The role of MED30 in urological tumours is unknown. Materials and methods: First, a database analysis using cBioPortal was performed for the mRNA expression and survival analysis of MED30 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and papillary RCC (pRCC). The immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) against MED30 was performed on tissue microarrays (TMA), with benign, ccRCC, pRCC samples, and ccRCC-metastases. Intensity evaluation was performed using the IRS (Immunoreactive Score). The ccRCC cell lines ACHN and A-498 were used for the functional investigation of proliferation, migration, and invasion after the knockdown of MED30 by siRNA. Results: In a database analysis by cBioPortal, it was shown that mRNA overexpression of MED30 in the pRCC was significantly associated with a poorer overall survival and progression-free survival. In the IHC, pRCC showed the highest level of MED30 expression, unfortunately without significant results in the survival analysis. The knockdown of MED30 resulted in a significant decrease in proliferation, migration, and invasion in ccRCC. Conclusion: In summary, MED30 seems to be involved in the progression of the RCC."
428483200028,CLINICAL NUTRITION,Soft drink consumption and gestational diabetes risk in the SUN project,"Background & aims: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevalence is increasing worldwide. To the best of our knowledge the specific evaluation of soft drink consumption as a risk factor for developing GDM has only been conducted in the Nurses' Health Study II. Objective: To investigate the incidence of GDM according to soft drink consumption in the SUN project. Design: The ""Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra"" (SUN) project is a prospective and dynamic cohort which included data of 3396 women who notified at least one pregnancy between December 1999 and March 2012. A validated 136-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess soft drink consumption. Four categories of sugar-sweetened soft drink (SSSD) and diet soft drink (DSD) consumption (servings) were established: rarely or never (< 1/month), low (1-3/month), intermediate (> 3/month and <= 1/week) and high (>= 2/week). Potential confounders were adjusted through non-conditional logistic regression models. Results: During the follow-up, we identified 172 incident cases of GDM. After adjusting for age, baseline body mass index, family history of diabetes, smoking, total energy intake, physical activity, parity, fast-food consumption, adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern, alcohol intake, multiple pregnancy, cardiovascular disease/hypertension at baseline, fiber intake, following special diet and snacking, SSSD consumption was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident GDM, with multivariable adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 2.03 (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.25-3.31) and 1.67 (95% Cl: 1.01-2.77) for the highest and intermediate categories, respectively, versus the lowest category (p for linear trend: 0.006). Conversely, DSD consumption was not associated with GDM incidence (adjusted OR: 0.82; 95% Cl: 0.52-1.31) for the highest versus the lowest category (p for linear trend: 0.258). Additional sensitivity analyses did not change the results. Conclusion: Higher consumption of SSSDs before pregnancy was an independent risk factor for GDM, however, no association was observed between DSD consumption and GDM risk.

445987100011,BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT,A generic simulation model for prediction of thermal conditions and human performance in cockpits,"This paper presents a computational approach to predict the thermal environment in a cockpit during on-ground and in-flight aircraft operation. A method was developed to model cockpit air temperature, which serves as input to black-globe and wet-bulb temperature computation. Subsequently the simulated temperatures are used to compute common heat stress indices such as Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS), or Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). To demonstrate the manifold information made available by the computed heat stress indices, WBGT e.g. is set in relation to different types of occupational exposure limits demonstrating not only the possibility to predict physiological constraints but mental performance too. The generic cockpit model and thermal comfort computations were validated against experimental data gained from on ground temperature measurements inside an aircraft cockpit, which underwent a sudden large temperature change. The results exemplify how thermal comfort and possible physical as well as mental degradation of aircrews can be assessed quickly using the presented model."
419114100002,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY,A robust butt welding seam finding technique for intelligent robotic welding system using active laser vision,"Intelligent robotic welding requires automatic finding of the seam geometrical features in order for an efficient intelligent control. Performance of the system, therefore, heavily depends on the success of the seam finding stage. Among various seam finding techniques, active laser vision is the most effective approach. It typically requires high-quality lasers, camera and optical filters. The success of the algorithm is highly sensitive to the image processing and feature extraction algorithms. In this work, sequential image processing and feature extraction algorithms are proposed to effectively extract the seam geometrical properties from a low-quality laser image captured without the conventional narrow band filter. A novel method of laser segmentation and detection is proposed. The segmentation method involves averaging, colour processing and blob analysis. The detection method is based on a novel median filtering technique that involves enhancing of the image object based on its underlying structure and orientation in the image. The method when applied enhances the vertically oriented laser stripe in the image which improves the laser peak detection. The image processing steps are performed to make sure that the laser profile is accurately extracted within the region of interest (ROI). Feature extraction algorithm based on pixels' intensity distribution and neighbourhood search is also proposed that can effectively extract the seam feature points. The proposed algorithms have been implemented and evaluated on various background complexities, seam sizes, material type and laser types before and during the welding operation."

The purposes of this study were, among patients with heart failure (HF), as follows: 1) to determine the interreviewer agreement for EOV and 2) to describe a novel, objective, and quantifiable measure of EOV. Methods This was a secondary analysis of the HEART Camp: Promoting Adherence to Exercise in Patients with Heart Failure study. EOV was determined through a blinded review by six individuals on the basis of their interpretation of the EOV literature. Interreviewer agreement was assessed using Fleiss kappa (). Final determination of EOV was based on agreement by four of the six reviewers. A new measure (ventilation dispersion index; VDI) was calculated for each test, and its ability to predict EOV was assessed with the receiver operator characteristics curve. Results Among 243 patients with HF (age, 60 12 yr; 45% women), the interreviewer agreement for EOV was fair ( = 0.303) with 10-s discrete data averages and significantly better, but only moderate ( = 0.429) with 30-s rolling data averages. Prevalence rates of positive and indeterminate EOVs were 18% and 30% with the 10-s discrete averages and 14% and 13% with the 30-s rolling averages, respectively. VDI was strongly associated with EOV, with areas under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 0.852 to 0.890. Conclusions Interreviewer agreement for EOV in patients with HF is fair to moderate, which can negatively affect risk stratification. VDI has strong predictive validity with EOV; as such, it might be a useful measure of prognosis in patients with HF."

A currently implemented device enables the reconstruction three complementary images for each coronal breast section. Based on in vivo breast examination, the authors developed an approach to breast diagnostics which employs ultrasound transmission and reflection tomography imaging. The obtained transmission images of ultrasound speed distribution show good correlation of glandular tissue areas with their visualization on MRI images. The results also allow a prediction that the implemented UST device offering fusion of reconstructed images may contribute to achieving a new standard for breast cancer diagnostics through non-invasive, fast and cheap screening tests.

425221500010,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE,The effect of beef production system on proximate composition and fatty acid profile of three beef muscles,"In this study the effects of animal age combined with feeding regime and the utilisation of a beta-agonist (within a grain-fed system) on proximate composition and fatty acid profile of M. longissimus lumborum (LL), M. biceps femoris (BF), and M. semitendinosus (ST) were determined. Eighty Bonsmara steers consisting of A-age (0 permanent incisors) grain-fed (AC) and grain-fed supplemented with a beta-agonist, zilpaterol (AZ) (n = 20) grass-fed AB-age (1 - 2 permanent incisors; AB) (n = 20), and B-age (3 - 6 permanent incisors; B) (n = 20) animals were used. These four groups are representative of cattle slaughtered in South Africa and were treated as four production systems. The chemical composition of all three muscles showed that zilpaterol increased protein and reduced muscle fat contents of meat. All the muscles of both grass-fed groups (AB and B) had significantly higher content of certain desirable fatty acids (FAs) such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), omega-3 (n-3) FAs, branched chain saturated phytanic acid, and a lower omega-6/omega-3 (n-6/n-3) ratio than the two grain-fed groups (AC and AZ). The FA composition of grain-fed beef muscle was generally not influenced by the use of zilpaterol except for a tendency towards higher n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in beta-agonist produced beef. This was mainly due to higher levels of linoleic acid in LL and ST muscles and higher CLA in BF muscle of AZ animals. Phytanic acid was also higher in BF muscle of the AZ group compared to AC. Differences in animal age among grass-fed animals (AB vs. B) had minimal effect on FA composition of grass-fed beef. We can conclude that differences in FA composition of the three muscles are influenced mainly by feeding regime and less by differences in production factors within feeding regimes."
451745000039,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,Differential capacitance of ionic liquids according to lattice-gas mean-field model with nearest-neighbor interactions,"The Bragg-Williams free energy is used to incorporate nearest-neighbor interactions into the lattice gas model of a solvent-free ionic liquid near a planar electrode. We calculate the differential capacitance from solutions of the mean-field consistency relation, arriving at an explicit expression in the limit of a weakly charged electrode. The two additional material parameters that appear in the theory-the degree of nonideality and the resistance to concentration changes of each ion type-give rise to different regimes that we identify and discuss. As the nonideality parameter, which becomes more positive for stronger nearest-neighbor attraction between like-charged ions, increases and the electrode is weakly charged, the differential capacitance is predicted to transition through a divergence and subsequently adopt negative values just before the ionic liquid becomes structurally unstable. This is associated with the spontaneous charging of an electrode at vanishing potential. The physical origin of the divergence and the negative sign of the differential capacitance is a nonmonotonic relationship between the surface potential and surface charge density, which reflects the formation of layered domains alternatingly enriched in counterions and coions near the electrode. The decay length of this layered domain pattern, which can be many times larger than the ion size, is reminiscent of the recently introduced concept of ""underscreening.""

444000000033,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL,Enhance performance of microbial fuel cell coupled surface flow constructed wetland by using submerged plants and enclosed anodes,"In this study, submerged plants and enclosed anodes were used to improve the performance of surface flow constructed wetland coupled microbial fuel cell system (CW-MFC). The peak cell voltage produced from CW-MFC planted with Hydrilla verticillata and equipped with enclosed anode was 558.50 mV, 66.22% higher than that of the system without these factors. Positive correlation between cell voltage and abundances of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Betaproteobacteria was obtained. Submerged plants could overcome the shortage of immoderate elongation caused by emerged plants' roots which would ruin electrode materials, and thus enhance power generation of CW-MFC. More importantly, system with enclosed anodes showed higher cell voltage, mainly because of the higher rates of diffusion in sediments and better advection of porewater to anode materials. In addition, the planted system showed the highest NH4+ -N removal rate, which was 88.92%, much higher than that of the unplanted system, which was 67.75%. In summary, submerged plants and enclosed anodes could improve the power generation of CW-MFC, along with better removal of NH4+ -N."
457817600006,ARCHIVOS ESPANOLES DE UROLOGIA,Preventive management of bone disease in advanced prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer is linked to bone disease by two different entities. On one hand, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) usually causes osteoporosis, on the other a great number of patients with advanced prostate cancer will present bone metastases, that condition not only their vital prognosis but also an important quality of life deterioration. METHODS: We performed a bibliographic review on both the physiology and therapy of osteoporosis secondary to ADT and bone metastasis in prostatic neoplasias. RESULTS: Osteoporosis: Long term ADT is associated with osteopenia/osteoporosis in 80% of the patients, with a 5-20% incidence of osteoporotic fractures. We should monitor bone mineral density before starting ADT therapy and during treatment. Treatment is based on risk factors reduction, regular physical exercise, calcium and vitamin D supplements, and drugs such as biphosphonates or denosumab. Bone metastasis: Currently, both zolendronic acid and denosumab have approval for the prevention of skeletal events in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CPRC). Although the last one seems to be more effective, it is associated with a higher risk of hypocalcemia and jaw osteonecrosis so that the choice of drug must be individualized in every patient. The duration of treatment is not clear. Currently, the indication for the use of this drugs in earlier phases of advanced disease is not approved. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive management of the patient with advanced prostate cancer should include the study and treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastases. Currently, very effective therapies are available for both entities."
439134200003,GENOME BIOLOGY,Epistasis analysis uncovers hidden antibiotic resistance-associated fitness costs hampering the evolution of MRSA,"Background: Fitness costs imposed on bacteria by antibiotic resistance mechanisms are believed to hamper their dissemination. The scale of these costs is highly variable. Some, including resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to the clinically important antibiotic mupirocin, have been reported as being cost-free, which suggests that there are few barriers preventing their global spread. However, this is not supported by surveillance data in healthy communities, which indicate that this resistance mechanism is relatively unsuccessful. Results: Epistasis analysis on two collections of MRSA provides an explanation for this discord, where the mupirocin resistance-conferring mutation of the ileS gene appears to affect the levels of toxins produced by S. aureus when combined with specific polymorphisms at other loci. Proteomic analysis demonstrates that the activity of the secretory apparatus of the PSM family of toxins is affected by mupirocin resistance. As an energetically costly activity, this reduction in toxicity masks the fitness costs associated with this resistance mutation, a cost that becomes apparent when toxin production becomes necessary. This hidden fitness cost provides a likely explanation for why this mupirocin-resistance mechanism is not more prevalent, given the widespread use of this antibiotic. Conclusions: With dwindling pools of antibiotics available for use, information on the fitness consequences of the acquisition of resistance may need to be considered when designing antibiotic prescribing policies. However, this study suggests there are levels of depth that we do not understand, and that holistic, surveillance and functional genomics approaches are required to gain this crucial information."
438669800018,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY,Prediction of Recidivism With the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (Reduced Version) in a Sample of Young Spanish Offenders,"Intervention in youth recidivism is critical in helping prevent young people from continuing their criminal career into adulthood, on a life-course-persistent trajectory. Andrews and Bonta attempt to provide an explanation of risk and protective factors using a conversion of the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI), which predicts recidivism. In this study, scores have been obtained from 382 adolescents (M age = 16.33 years) from the juvenile court, to check the ability of a reduced version of the YLS/CMI, to predict recidivism. The outcome variables for recidivism were examined in the 2-year follow-up period, after their first assessment in the court. The risk factors showed good levels of recidivism prediction. Recidivists obtained significant higher mean total risk scores than nonrecidivists in the reduced (M = 6.54, SD = 2.44; M = 3.66, SD = 2.85), with areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from .601 to .857. The factors that emerged as the most discriminative were education/employment, criminal friends, and personality. All the protective factors differentiated between recidivists and nonrecidivists. The results, therefore, showed that this reduced version would be capable of predicting youth recidivism in a reliable way."
452934700013,QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS,A below-the-present late Holocene relative sea level and the glacial isostatic adjustment during the Holocene in the Malay Peninsula,"This study has reconstructed the Holocene relative sea-level history in the relatively tectonically stable Malay Peninsula with two specific objectives: quantifying the sea-level indicative meanings of mangrove sediments and producing new high-quality sea-level index points. In this study, a wetland on the east coast of the Peninsula was extensively surveyed; the elevational relationship between habitat zones and their pollen and diatom assemblages was established; and a number of indicative meanings were precisely quantified for this wetland. This quantified relationship is extrapolated to other coastal sites of the Peninsula for re-calibration of previously published mangrove-based sea-level data. The reconstructed sea-level history from the new and re-calibrated data demonstrates a period of rapid sea-level rise at a rate of 15.8 +/- 3.9 mm/a between 10,500 cal a BP at -35.0 +/- 4.3 m and 9000 cal a BP at -14.2 +/- 1.6 m. The rate of rising sea level was gradually reduced to zero from 9000 to 5000 cal a BP, and by the end of this period the relative sea level reached a highstand of c. 3.3 +/- 0.2 m. Over the past 5000 years relative sea level fell to its lowest point at -0.6 +/- 0.1 m by 800 cal a BP. This far-field sea-level history has been driven by the global ice-volume change and glacial isostatic adjustment, and it matches well with the modelled ice-volume equivalent sea level.

Millions of quasiclassical trajectories on these PESs reveal that (a) in the case of standard methods, increasing the basis from DZ to TZ decreases the S(N)2 cross sections by 20-30%; (b) the explicitly correlated F12 reactivity is converged with a DZ basis; (c) the quasi-variational OQVCCD(T) and the CCSD(T) methods provide virtually the same cross sections; (d) the above DFT functionals give significantly larger S(N)2 cross sections than the ab initio methods; (e) retention S(N)2 cross sections show striking method and basis dependence and double inversion is substantially enhanced with a TZ basis or F12 methods; (f) the TZ basis doubles the DZ proton-transfer reactivity; (g) at a high collision energy ab initio methods show dominance of backward scattering, in agreement with experiment, whereas most DFT functionals provide slight forward preference; and (h) at high energy the ab initio correlation (DFT) methods slightly underestimate (overestimate) the CH3F internal energy excitations, whereas the broad experimental distribution is qualitatively reproduced."
447652200002,THIN SOLID FILMS,Preparation of novel photosensitive indium niobate gel films and their characteristics,"In this study, preparation of photosensitive indium niobate (InNbO4) gel films by using a chemical modification reagent and their characteristics were investigated. In the electronic absorption spectra of the InNbO4 gel films, the absorption peak assigned a chelate ring was observed at 340 nm, this peak intensity decreased by UV irradiation. From this result, the obtained gel films exhibit photosensitivity. About 10 mu m patterns could be fabricated. The InNbO4 film heat-treated at 600-900 degrees C exhibited diffraction peaks of monoclinic crystals and the photoinduced hydrophillic properties."
448901400002,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE IMMUNOLOGY,"New insights into the efficacy of SR-16234, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on the growth of murine endometriosis-like lesions","Problem: To evaluate the effects of SR-16234 (SR), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), on murine endometriosis-like lesions. Method of study: BALB/c mice (n = 53) were used to establish the murine endometriosis model. Ovariectomized, estradiol replaced, 6-week-old murine endometriosis model were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without SR (1 mg/kg/d) or vehicle, over a period of 4 weeks. Upon treatment completion, the endometriosis-like lesions that developed in the abdominal cavity of mice were counted, measured, and collected. Gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and estrogen receptor (ER) in the lesions was assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the effect of SR on cell proliferation, angiogenic activity, inflammation, and NF-kappa B phosphorylation. Results: Treatment with SR significantly reduced the total number and size of lesions per mouse without inducing endometrial growth. In addition, SR down-regulated LPS-enhanced Vegf, Il-6, Ptgs-2, and Ccl-2 and ER mRNA expression in endometriosis-like lesions. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a decrease in percentage of positive cells of Ki67, and intensity and rate of positive cells of ER alpha, CD3, F4/80, PECAM by SR treatment. SR also decreased the expression of NF-kappa B p65 and phospho-NF-kappa B p65. Conclusion: SR has a regressive effect on the development of murine endometriosis-like lesions."

Using family systems theories and the concept of co-parenting, it analyses the fragile and complex relationship caseworkers and foster parents have with biological parents. The paper presents four components that might play a role in encouraging parental involvement to benefit their children's adjustment. The components are demonstrated through case studies and include assessing the family profile; addressing the family's needs within the child's intervention plan; training biological and foster parents; and building co-parenting between biological and foster parents."
439576500029,STROKE,Why Are Only Some Subcortical Ischemic Lesions on Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Associated With Stroke Symptoms in Small Vessel Disease?,"Background and Purpose In cerebral small vessel diseases, small subcortical ischemic lesions (SSIL) on diffusion imaging are responsible for stroke manifestations but can also be occasionally observed in the absence of overt neurological symptoms. We aimed to determine, in a large cohort of young patients with CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal-Dominant Arteriopathy With Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), a severe monogenic condition leading to SSIL in young patients, the characteristics of SSIL and of surrounding cerebral tissue associated with the presence of stroke symptoms. Methods Among a cohort of 323 genetically confirmed CADASIL patients who were systematically evaluated every 18 months clinically and with magnetic resonance imaging, we studied all visible SSIL and documented ischemic stroke events with available magnetic resonance imaging data. We used mixed-effect logistic regression models to determine whether the presence of stroke symptoms was associated with age, sex, the volume of SSIL, their location with respect to preexisting white matter hyperintensities and with the load of the different magnetic resonance imaging markers of small vessel disease. Results We identified 73 SSIL (30 with stroke symptoms and 43 without) in 55 patients. In multivariable models, stroke symptoms were more frequent in male patients (estimate=1.94; SE=0.82; P=0.03) and less frequent when SSIL appeared in contact to preexisting white matter hyperintensities (estimate=-2.12; SE=0.83; P=0.01). Within pyramidal tracts, stroke symptoms were more frequent in patients with extensive white matter hyperintensities (estimate=3.8x10(-5); SE=9.3x10(-6); P<10(-4)). Conclusions Altogether, our results suggest that when SSIL occur, the presence of stroke symptoms may depend on sex and alterations of the surrounding brain tissue rather than on the characteristics of the SSIL itself."
418083100027,COMMUNICATIONS IN ALGEBRA,On the Loewy length of the center of a block with elementary abelian defect groups,"Let G be a finite group and k an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. In this paper we investigate the Loewy structure of centers of indecomposable group algebras kG, for groups G with a normal elementary abelian Sylow p-subgroup. Furthermore, we show a reduction result for the case that a normal abelian Sylow p-subgroup is acted upon by a subgroup of its automorphism group; this is fundamental in providing generic formulae for the Loewy lengths considered."
446174400004,NEPHROLOGY,Acute kidney injury is common with intravenous abuse of extended-release oral oxymorphone and delayed renal recovery rates are associated with increased KDIGO staging,"AimPrescription opioid abuse poses a serious problem in the United States, representing 615 per 100000 deaths annually. Extended-release oxymorphone (Opana-ER) is an oral opioid pain medication that has recently been found to cause thrombotic microangiopathy when intravenously abused. In this retrospective study, we attempted to determine the prevalence and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) among patients intravenously abusing extended-release oral oxymorphone. MethodsA query of electronic medical records for drug abuse' at an academic medical centre during January 2012 to December 2015 was performed and yielded 2350 patients. Patients were further identified by documented intravenous abuse of extended-release oxymorphone. Patients were stratified based on multiple renal indices and outcomes. Potential confounders were also identified. ResultsOne hundred and sixty-five patients were found to have a documented history of intravenous abuse of extended-release oral oxymorphone. Prevalence of AKI in this population was a 47.8%. KDIGO stage-I patients consisted of 17.8% of patients with AKI, 40.5% were classified as KDIGO stage-II AKI, and 41.8% were classified as KDIGO stage-III AKI. Among patients with AKI, average age was found to be 37.5years, 59.4% experienced renal recovery, 56.9% required intensive care unit admission, 13.9% progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and 7.6% expired during admission. ConclusionClinicians should be educated to help recognize intravenous abuse of extended-release oral oxymorphone and its associated effects. Our data suggests AKI is common in these patients; higher KDIGO staging appears to be associated with slower rates of renal recovery, increased comorbidities and progression to both CKD and ESRD."
448821900013,WATER,Intensity and Persistence of Soil Water Repellency in Pine Forest Soil in a Temperate Continental Climate under Drought Conditions,"Although soil water repellency (SWR) has been reported under different soils, climates, and vegetation types of the world, especially in forest land and following wildfires, the understanding of this variable continues to be rather limited. This study presented the characterization of SWR from wild fire measurements in a Scots pine Peucedano-Pinetum forest in the Kampinos National Park (central Poland), which is characterized by a temperate continental climate. The main objectives were: [i] To evaluate the potential occurrence, intensity, and persistence of soil water repellency in the surface layers of podzolized rusty soils during a dry summer; [ii] to determine whether a wildfire increased SWR, compared to the unburnt condition of soil; and [iii] to identify changes in hydrophobicity 13 months after a fire. The Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) test was used to assess persistence and intensity of soil SWR. Hydrophobicity is a natural phenomenon during periods of drought in temperate continental climates. The extreme class of SWR was observed in surface layers of up to 20 cm. A higher hydrophobicity was noted in the older habitats of the Peucedano-Pinetum forest. Maximum WDPT values (10,800 s) were found for an older ecosystem cover, during a dry summer. SWR in fire-affected soils is dependent on the intensity of the fire, as well as displaying spatial and seasonal variability. Thirteen months after a fire, the highest variability in the occurrence of non-wettability, was recorded in the surface layers of areas affected by a weak fire. A positive relationship between soil pH and WDPT values was determined to a 20 cm depth. Prolonged dry periods resulting from global climate change, may enhance the effects of increasing SWR; it therefore seems reasonable for future research on biosphere-climate interactions, to take the presence of hydrophobicity into account."
454378700025,ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS,An integrated framework for multi-criteria optimization of thin concrete shells at early design stages,"Thin shells are crucially dependent on their shape in order to obtain proper structural performance. In this context, the optimal shape will guarantee performance and safety requirements, while minimizing the use of materials, as well as construction/maintenance costs. Thin shell design is a team-based, multidisciplinary, and iterative process, which requires a high level of interaction between the various parties involved, especially between the Architecture and Engineering teams. As a result of technological development, novel concepts and tools become available to support this process. On the one hand, concepts like Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) show the potential to have a high impact on multidisciplinary environments such as the one in question, supporting the early decision-making process with the availability of as much information as possible. On the other hand, optimization techniques and tools should be highlighted, as they fit the needs and requirements of both the shell shape definition process and the IPD concept. These can be used not only to support advanced design stages, but also to facilitate the initial formulation of shape during the early interactions between architect and structural engineer from an IPD point of view. This paper proposes a methodology aimed at enhancing the interactive and iterative process associated with the early stages of thin shell design, supported by an integrated framework. The latter is based on several tools, namely Rhinoceros 3D, Grasshopper, and Robot Structural Analysis. In order to achieve full integration of the support tools, a custom devised module was developed, so as to allow interoperability between Grasshopper and Robot Structural Analysis. The system resorts to various technologies targeted at improving the shell shape definition process, such as formfinding techniques, parametric and generative models, as well as shape optimization techniques that leverage on multi criteria evolutionary algorithms. The proposed framework is implemented in a set of fictitious scenarios, in which the best thin reinforced concrete shell structures are sought according to given design requirements. Results stemming from this implementation emphasize its interoperability, flexibility, and capability to promote interaction between the elements of the design team, ultimately outputting a set of diverse and creative shell shapes, and thus supporting the pre-design process."
440875100001,ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS,Dynamical evolution of C/2017 K2 PANSTARRS,"Context. The comet C/2017 K2 PANSTARRS drew attention to its activity at the time of its discovery in May 2017 when it was about 16 au from the Sun. This Oort spike comet will approach its perihelion in December 2022, and the question about its dynamical past is an important issue to explore. Aims. In order to answer the question of whether C/2017 K2 is a dynamically old or new comet it is necessary to obtain its precise osculating orbit, its original orbit, and propagate its motion backwards in time to the previous perihelion. Knowledge of the previous perihelion distance is necessary to distinguish between these two groups of the Oort spike comets. We have studied the dynamical evolution of C/2017 K2 to the previous perihelion (backward calculations for about 3-4 Myr) as well as to the future (forward calculations for about 0.033 Myr) using the swarm of virtual comets (VCs) constructed from a nominal osculating orbit of this comet which we determined here using all positional measurements available at the moment. Outside the planetary system both Galactic and stellar perturbations were taken into account. Results. We derive that C/2017 K2 is a dynamically old Oort spike comet (1/a(prev) = (48.7 +/- 7.9) x 10(-6) au(-1)) with the previous perihelion distance below 10 au for 97% of VCs (nominal q(prev) = 3.77 au). According to the present data this comet will be perturbed into a more tightly bound orbit after passing the planetary zone (1/a(fut) = (1140.4 +/- 8.0) x 10(-6) au 1, q(fut) = 1.79336 +/- 0.00006 au) provided that non-gravitational effects will not change the orbit significantly. Conclusions. C/2017 K2 has already visited our planetary zone during its previous perihelion passage. Thus, it is almost certainly a dynamically old Oort spike comet. The future orbital solution of this comet is formally very precise, however, it is much less definitive since the presented analysis is based on pre-perihelion data taken at very large heliocentric distances (23.7-14.6 au from the Sun), and this comet can experience a significant non-gravitational perturbation during the upcoming perihelion passage in 2022."
430393200004,JOURNAL OF ESTHETIC AND RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY,Color difference thresholds for computer-simulated human Gingiva,"Objective: To determine 50:50% perceptibility threshold (PT) and 50:50% acceptability threshold (AT) for computer-simulated samples of human gingiva using CIEDE2000 and CIELAB color difference formulas. Materials and Methods: Each of the 60 pairs of simulated human gingiva was displayed on a calibrated monitor, together with three pairs of upper central incisors of different lightness. The color of gingiva left and right from the midline was compared. A total of 30 observers (15 dentists, 15 laypersons) participated in the study. CIEDE2000 and CIELAB formulas were used to calculate the thresholds and a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy Approximation model was used as fitting procedure. Paired t-test (alpha = 0.05) was used in evaluation of statistical significance of differences. Results: The PT and AT for CIEDE2000 and 95% confidence intervals were 1.1 [0.4, 1.7] and 2.8 [1.8, 4.0], respectively. Corresponding CIELAB values were 1.7 [0.2, 2.6] and 3.7 [2.1, 5.7]. Significant differences (P < .01) were recorded between PT and AT, between the corresponding threshold values in CIEDE2000 and CIELAB formulas as well as between dentists and laypersons. Conclusions: The difference between the perceptibility and acceptability threshold for gingiva was statistically significant in both CIEDE2000 and CIELAB. The same was true for differences between the corresponding thresholds using two color difference formulas, and between dentists and laypersons. Visual thresholds of human gingiva were not dependent upon lightness of adjacent teeth. Overall, CIEDE2000 color difference formula provided better fit than CIELAB formula in the evaluation of color difference thresholds of human gingiva. Clinical Significance: The data on visual thresholds for healthy human gingiva can be used as quality control tool/guide for selection and evaluation of dental materials, interpretation of color-related findings in clinical dentistry and research, and for standardization in dentistry. It is of particular value that this study was designed based on in-vivo color evaluation of healthy keratinized gingiva of subjects of different ethnicities, age groups, and gender."
434062400001,BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES,"Predictors of pediatric tuberculosis in public health facilities of Bale zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia: a case control study","Background: Tuberculosis is among the top ten cause of death (9th) from a single infectious agent worldwide. It even ranks above HIV/AIDS. It is among the top 10 causes of death among children. Globally there are estimates of one million cases of TB in children, 76% occur in 22 high-burden countries among which Ethiopia ranked 8th. Despite this fact, children with TB are given low priority in most national health programs. Moreover reports on childhood TB and its predictors are very limited. Therefore this study aimed to assess predictors of pediatric Tuberculosis in Public Health Facilities. Methods: Unmatched case control study among a total samples of 432 (144 cases and 288 controls) were done from August to December 2016 in Bale zone, South East Ethiopia. Pediatric TB patients who attended health facilities for DOTS and those who attended health facilities providing DOTS service for any health problem except for TB were the study population for cases and controls, respectively. For each case two consecutive controls were sampled systematically. Data were collected using pretested and structured questionnaire through face to face interview with parents. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to identify predictors of Tuberculosis. Result: Among cases there were equal number of male and female 71(50%). However among control 136 (47.9%) were male and the rest were female. The mean (standard deviation) of age among cases was 8.4 (+/- 4.3) and controls were 7.3 (+/- 4.1). The odds ofTB were 2 times (AOR, 95% CI = 1.94(1.02-3.77)) more likely among 11-15 age group children when compared with children of age group <= 5. HIV status of the child, children who were fed raw milk and absence of BCG vaccination were the other predictors of pediatric TB with AOR 13.6(3.45-53.69), 4.23(2.26-7.88), and 5. 46(1.82-16.32) respectively. Conclusion: Children who were not BCG Vaccinated were at risk of developing TB. Turthermore, HIV status, age of the child and family practice of feeding children raw milk are the independent predicators of pediatric TB in the study area."
428360300003,ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,DNA damage and micronuclei in parthenogenetic and bisexual Darevskia rock lizards from the areas with different levels of soil pollution,"Natural species are widely used as indicator organisms to estimate of the impact of environmental pollution. Here we present the results of first study of a reliability of parthenogenetic Darevskia armeniaca and bisexual Darevskia raddei rock lizards as sentinels for monitoring of environmental genotoxicity. The comet assay and micronucleus test were applied to the lizards sampled in six areas in Armenia and Artsakh with different levels of soil contamination. The results obtained showed a clear relationship between the pollution level of lizards' habitats and the frequency of DNA damage in the comet assay. Low baseline frequency of micronuclei in D. armeniaca and D. raddei, however, makes this parameter ineffective for environmental genotoxicity evaluation. The parthenogenetic lizards D. armeniaca showed higher sensitivity toward genotoxic pollutions compared with bisexual D. raddei living in the same environment. The correlations between soil content of heavy metals Cr, Cu, Zn, Mo, Pb and DNA damage in D. armeniaca and between Cu, As, Mo, Pb and DNA damage in D. raddei were revealed. Overall, the lizards D. raddei and D. armeniaca appeared to be sensitive species in detecting soil pollution in natural environment. The application of the comet assay in Darevskia lizard species can be considered as a more appropriate method than a micronucleus test. The use of parthenogenetic lizards D. armeniaca as bioindicator will permit to assess the environmental genotoxicity independent of the genetic polymorphism of bisexual species."
440583800039,MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS,Apigenin suppresses the apoptosis of H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury via upregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway,"Apigenin, a flavonoid with multiple physiological and pharmacological activities, is associated with the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The present study aimed to examine the roles and mechanisms of apigenin in the apoptosis of H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes, which were subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cellular apoptosis were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assays and flow cytometry. The content/activity of oxidative stress markers was determined using commercial kits. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to measure protein and mRNA expression, respectively. The results demonstrated that apigenin had limited cytotoxicity on the viability of H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes. Apigenin reduced the oxidative stress, ROS production and cellular apoptotic capacity of MI/R-induced H9C2 cells. Apigenin additionally increased the MMP level of MI/R-induced H9C2 cells. Furthermore, apigenin modulated apoptosis-associated protein expression and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/RAC- serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) signaling in MI/R-induced H9C2 cells. Treatment with LY294002 reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of apigenin. In conclusion, apigenin suppressed the apoptosis of H9C2 cells that were subjected to MI/R injury by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. It was suggested that apigenin may be effective as an MI/R therapy."

They are attacked by a wide range of parasitoids. We studied parasitoid complexes of several communities in Austria, Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Sweden during 2014-2018. From four species, Yponomeuta cagnagella (Hubner), Yponomeuta evonymella (Linnaeus), Yponomeuta malinellus Zeller and Yponomeuta padella (Linnaeus), we reared 15 parasitoid species of seven hymenopteran and one dipteran family. In this study, the family Ichneumonidae is the most numerous, while Ageniaspis fuscicollis (Dalman) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was found in all four Yponomeuta species. Within reared parasitoids, A. fuscicollis is new record for Slovenia and Austria, Baryscapus evonymellae (Bouche) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and Diadegma armillatum (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) are new records for Slovenia and Agrypon canaliculatum (Ratzeburg) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), Dolichogenidea dilecta (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), Elasmus steffani Viggiani (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), Herpestomus brunnicornis (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), Trieces tricarinatus (Holmgren) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) and Mesochorus nuncupator (Panzer) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) are new records for Serbia. Also, Yponomeuta cagnagella is a new host record for Pteromalus semotus (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) and Y. padella for E. steffani. Finally, we reviewed parasitoids of European Yponomeuta species and their associated host plants. In total 154 species are recorded from nine hymenopteran and one dipteran family."
424951300012,CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS,Asymmetric learning ability promotes cooperation in structured populations,"In this paper, we consider an asymmetric learning ability in structured population. The rate of strategy adoption from one randomly neighbor is controlled by the payoff difference and a factor alpha. Players of type B will think over alpha(alpha> 1) times when he decides whether to adopt his opponent's strategy. While players of type A just consider only once. The concentration of players A and B are denoted by v and 1-v and remains unchanged during the simulations. Through numerous computing simulations, we find that our new setup of asymmetric learning ability can promote the evolution cooperation in the spatial prisoner's dilemma game. Furthermore, in order to explore the generality of this finding, we have tested the results on spatial public good games and random regular graphs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
444929800006,STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF MODERN PHYSICS,Constraints on macroscopic realism without assuming non-invasive measurability,"Macroscopic realism is the thesis that macroscopically observable properties must always have definite values. The idea was introduced by Leggett and Garg (1985), who wished to show a conflict with the predictions of quantum theory, by using it to derive an inequality that quantum theory violates. However, Leggett and Garg's analysis required not just the assumption of macroscopic realism per se, but also that the observable properties could be measured non-invasively. In recent years there has been increasing interest in experimental tests of the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality, but it has remained a matter of controversy whether this second assumption is a reasonable requirement for a macroscopic realist view of quantum theory. In a recent critical assessment Maroney and Timpson (2014) identified three different categories of macroscopic realism, and argued that only the simplest category could be ruled out by Leggett-Garg inequality violations. Allen, Maroney, and Gogioso (2016) then showed that the second of these approaches was also incompatible with quantum theory in Hilbert spaces of dimension 4 or higher. However, we show that the distinction introduced by Maroney and Timpson between the second and third approaches is not noise tolerant, so unfortunately Allen's result, as given, is not directly empirically testable. In this paper we replace Maroney and Timpson's three categories with a parameterization of macroscopic realist models, which can be related to experimental observations in a noise tolerant way, and recover the original definitions in the noise-free limit. We show how this parameterization can be used to experimentally rule out classes of macroscopic realism in Hilbert spaces of dimension 3 or higher, without any use of the non-invasive measurability assumption. Even for relatively low precision experiments, this will rule out the original category of macroscopic realism, that is tested by the Leggett-Garg inequality, while as the precision of the experiments increases, all cases of the second category and many cases of the third category, will become experimentally ruled out.

443031300001,FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY,Impact of Anesthetic Management on Safety and Outcomes Following Mechanical Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke in SWIFT PRIME Cohort,"Background and purpose: The optimal anesthetic management of acute ischemic stroke patients during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains controversial. In this post-hoc analysis, we investigated the impact of anesthesia type on clinical outcomes in patients included in SWIFT PRIME trial. Methods: Ninety-seven patients treated with MT were included. Patients treated in centers with general anesthesia (GA) policy (n = 32) were compared with those treated in centers with conscious sedation (CS) policy (n = 65). Primary outcomes studied included times to treatment initiation (TTI), rates of successful recanalization (TICI 2b/3), and functional independence (mRS 0-2 at 90 days). Secondary outcomes were adverse events, lowest systolic and diastolic blood pressures (LSBP and LDBP) during MT. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression logistic modeling were conducted. Results: The GA-policy and CS-policy groups presented comparable TTI (94 +/- 36 min vs. 102 +/- 48 min; p = 0.44), rates of TICI 2b/3 recanalization (22/32 [68.8%] vs. 51/65 [78.5%]; p = 0.32). CS-policy was associated to higher rate of functional independence than GA-policy, but the difference was not significant (43/65 [66.2%] vs. 16/32 [50.0%]; p = 0.18). GA-policy patients had a higher rate of postoperative pneumonia (11/32 [34.4%] vs. 8/65 [12.3%]; p = 0.02) and lower LSBP (110 [30,160] mmHg vs. 119 [77,170] mmHg; p = 0.03) and LDBP (55 (15,75) mmHg vs. 67 [40,121]; p < 0.001). When corrected for differences in baseline characteristics, GA-policy was associated with lower rate of functional independence (OR 0.32; p = 0.05). A 10-point increase in perprocedural LDBP was associated with an increased likelihood of favorable outcome (OR 1.51; p = 0.01). Conclusions: GA-policy for MT presented comparable TTI and rates of successful revascularization to CS-policy. However, GA-policy was associated with lower rates of functional independence and with higher incidence of perprocedural hypotension and postoperative pneumonia."
435267300036,MICROWAVE AND OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY LETTERS,Design of ultra wide-bandwidth double-layer electromagnetic wave absorbers with square-loop frequency selective surfaces,"A thin and ultra wide-bandwidth microwave absorber is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally through simple layering 2 square loop-frequency selective surfaces (SL-FSSs) with different geometries on a grounded dielectric substrate. The circuit parameters of the SL-FSS inductance (L) and capacitance (C) are retrieved using the equivalent circuit model and are utilized in the design of the wide bandwidth absorber. The L and C values increase with increases in the unit cell dimension, and thereby the absorption frequency band can be controlled by the SL-FSS geometries. The optimal control for the surface resistance of the SL-FSSs and the spacer (assumed by air) thickness of the double-layer absorber provide a 10 dB absorption bandwidth of 6.3-38.3 GHz with a total thickness of 6.4 mm. The free-space measurement with the test samples fabricated by the screen printing process provides a still wide bandwidth of 5.6-30.8 GHz with the same total thickness."
440345800001,MOLECULAR BREEDING,High-throughput marker assays for FaRPc2-mediated resistance to Phytophthora crown rot in octoploid strawberry,"Phytophthora crown rot (PhCR) caused by Phytophthora cactorum is a destructive disease of the allo-octoploid cultivated strawberry (Fragaria xananassa Duch). Many major strawberry cultivars grown worldwide are susceptible to PhCR. Resistance is conferred by the recently-discovered FaRPc2 locus, but high-throughput markers are not yet available for marker-assisted breeding. In the current study, we developed DNA markers for two haplotypes at the FaRPc2 locus associated with resistance, H2 and H3. Marker validation and marker-assisted selection were performed in University of Florida (UF) breeding population. Seven single nucleotide polymorphism-based high resolution melting (HRM) markers linked to H2 and four HRM markers for H3 were developed. One HRM marker, RPCHRM3 linked to H3, was converted to a Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) marker. To further examine the utility of the markers, they were screened in University of California Davis cultivars with known phenotypes as well as in 20 diverse accessions with phenotypes that are reported in the literature and that are preserved at the USDA-ARS National Clonal Germplasm Repository, in Corvallis, Oregon. The most informative markers for FaRPc2 resistance are being implemented in the UF strawberry breeding program to improve PhCR resistance."
423495100112,PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS,Universality in the dynamical properties of seismic vibrations,"We have studied the statistical properties of the observed magnitudes of seismic vibration data in discrete time in an attempt to understand the underlying complex dynamical processes. The observed magnitude data are taken from six different geographical locations. All possible magnitudes are considered in the analysis including catastrophic vibrations, foreshocks, aftershocks and commonplace daily vibrations. The probability distribution functions of these data sets obey scaling law and display a certain universality characteristic. To investigate the universality features in the observed data generated by a complex process, we applied Random Matrix Theory (RMT) in the framework of Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). For all these six places the observed data show a close fit with the predictions of RMT. This reinforces the idea of universality in the dynamical processes generating seismic vibrations.

435179000010,CANCERS,Differentiation Therapy Targeting the beta-Catenin/CBP Interaction in Pancreatic Cancer,"Background: Although canonical Wnt signaling is known to promote tumorigenesis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a cancer driven principally by mutant K-Ras, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which the Wnt effector beta-catenin regulates such tumorigenesis are largely unknown. We have previously demonstrated that beta-catenin's differential usage of the Kat3 transcriptional coactivator cyclic AMP-response element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) over its highly homologous coactivator p300 increases self-renewal and suppresses differentiation in other types of cancer. Aim/methods: To investigate Wnt-mediated carcinogenesis in PDAC, we have used the specific small molecule CBP/P-catenin antagonist, ICG-001, which our lab identified and has extensively characterized, to examine its effects in human pancreatic cancer cells and in both an orthotopic mouse model and a human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of PDAC. Results/conclusion: We report for the first time that K-Ras activation increases the CBP/beta-catenin interaction in pancreatic cancer; and that ICG-001 specific antagonism of the CBP/beta- catenin interaction sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells and tumors to gemcitabine treatment. These effects were associated with increases in the expression of let-7a microRNA; suppression of K-Ras and survivin; and the elimination of drug-resistant cancer stem/tumor-initiating cells."
418883800010,APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE,Enhanced visible light-induced photocatalytic activity of surface-modified BiOBr with Pd nanoparticles,"Palladium nanoparticles well-dispersed on BiOBr surfaces were successfully prepared via a two-step process, namely hydrothermal synthesis of BiOBr followed by photo deposition of palladium. Surface-exposed palladium nanoparticles may improve the harvesting capacity of visible light photons via the surface plasmonic resonance effect to produce extra electrons. Palladium is an excellent electron acceptor, and therefore favours the separation of photo generated electron/hole pairs. As a result, palladium significantly improves the photo catalytic activity of BiOBr in the removal of organic pollutants (phenol) under visible light irradiation. In addition to as-prepared samples which were comprehensively characterized, the mechanism for the enhancement via the deposition of palladium nano particles was also proposed based on results. This work may serve as solid evidence to confirm that surface-deposited palladium nanoparticles are capable of improving photo catalytic activity, and that photo deposition may be an effective approach to load metal nanoparticles onto a surface.

418978200032,PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY,Implementation and experiment of an active vibration reduction strategy for macro-micro positioning system,"In microelectronics manufacturing, the macro-micro precision positioning system is often utilized to achieve a high-precision positioning motion with high-velocity and large-stroke. The working efficiency of the stage is affected by the inertial vibration of the macromotion which will cause more time to settle. This paper adopts an active vibration reduction method through a piezoelectric (PZT) device to quickly reduce the designed vibration amplitude of the macro-micro positioning stage. In the paper, we propose a dynamic adaptive vibration reduction strategy to work against the motion of the macro-stage through the PZT to settle the stage with much less time. The start-up condition and extension principle of the piezoelectric element used in the vibration reduction action are designed and finalized. The method can therefore dynamically start up the actuation of the PZT to act on the macromotion at right moment and determine the effect of the vibration reduction through the extension length of the PZT. A dynamic model, a force analysis, and an amplitude reduction analysis are performed to understand the vibration reduction action applied in the macro-micro stage and a dynamic simulation is conducted to examine the effect of the method. The experimental tests are carried out on the stage through the exploration of different extensions and waveform types of the piezoelectric device. The experimental results indicate that the settling time of the macromotion can be greatly reduced with the proposed method without decreasing its positioning accuracy for motion with high velocity and large stroke. This novel method is useful for applications of the electronic manufacturing equipment with high-velocity and high-accuracy requirements."
418868700010,SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL,Modulating a D-pi-A type diarylethene for on-demand Cu2+ check via photo-switchable detection range and sensitivity,"Detection range and sensitivity are two important parameters in a sensing system. Unfortunately, in common sensory systems, wide detection range always suffers from low sensitivity and vice versa. Thus, it becomes more and more desirable to design sensors with both wide detection range and high sensitivity. Here, we report a sensory system based on a photo-switchable D-pi-A type diarylethene (SDE), which presents both wide detection range and high sensitivity under alternate light modulation. The D-pi-A structure endows the sensor with high energy level of HOMO, which enabled the oxidation of both photoisomer SDEo/SDEc by Cu2+. While the discrepancy in energy levels of oxidation potentials in SDE photoisomers leads to their different reactivity, or in another word, sensitivity towards Cu2+. The inherent oxidative cycloreversion of SDEc to SDEo, on the other hand, provides a possibility that two photoisomers would detect Cu2+ in different working concentrations. The open form was employed for the detection of Cu2+ in a wider concentration range (0-13.0 equivalent) with relatively lower sensitivity (6.4 x 10(-7) M). While the closed form was able to probe Cu2+ in lower concentration (0-3.0 equivalent) with higher sensitivity (6.6 x 10(-9) M). Based on this photo-switchable sensing activity, a molecular multimeter of variable detection range for Cu2+ was then constructed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
454627200098,PLOS ONE,Functional characterization reveals that zebrafish CFTR prefers to occupy closed channel conformations,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the culprit behind the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), is a phosphorylation-activated, but ATP-gated anion channel. Studies of human CFTR over the past two decades have provided an in-depth understanding of how CFTR works as an ion channel despite its structural resemblance to ABC transporters. Recently-solved cryo-EM structures of unphosphorylated human and zebrafish CFTR (hCFTR and zCFTR), as well as phosphorylated ATP-bound zebrafish and human CFTR offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand CFTR's function at a molecular level. Interestingly, despite millions of years of phylogenetic distance between human and zebrafish, the structures of zCFTR and hCFTR exhibit remarkable similarities. In the current study, we characterized biophysical and pharmacological properties of zCFTR with the patch-clamp technique, and showed surprisingly very different functional properties between these two orthologs. First, while hCFTR has a single-channel conductance of 8.4 pS with a linear I-V curve, zCFTR shows an inwardly-rectified I-V relationship with a single-channel conductance of similar to 3.5 pS. Second, single-channel gating behaviors of phosphorylated zCFTR are very different from those of hCFTR, featuring a very low open probability P-o (0.03 +/- 0.02, vs. similar to 0.50 for hCFTR) with exceedingly long closed events and brief openings. In addition, unlike hCFTR where each open burst is clearly defined with rare short-lived flickery closures, the open bursts of zCFTR are not easily resolved. Third, although abolishing ATP hydrolysis by replacing the catalytic glutamate with glutamine (i.e., E1372Q) drastically prolongs the open bursts defined by the macroscopic relaxation analysis in zCFTR, the Po within a ""locked-open"" burst of E1372Q-zCFTR is only similar to 0.35 (vs. P-o > 0.94 in E1371Q-hCFTR). Collectively, our data not only provide a reasonable explanation for the unexpected closed-state structure of phosphorylated E1372Q-zCFTR with a canonical ATP-bound dimer of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), but also implicate significant structural and functional differences between these two evolutionarily distant orthologs."

The frequency domain approach includes the linearization of the system to obtain a linear model as well as the system matrix of which the eigenvalues can be calculated to determine the system stability. However, we often have high order of system matrix and thus it will be undesirable to calculate and analyze all the system eigenvalues. This paper is to explore the problem of small signal stability for the shipboard electric power system and the main purpose is to find out the worst-damped mode of system eigenvalues and thus to alleviate the effort for computing and analyzing all the system eigenvalues. A sample shipboard power system is taken as the study system. The worst-damped mode of system eigenvalues under different operating conditions are calculated for fast analysis and comparative investigations of the system small signal stability."

Target region based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (TMOEAs), aiming at a well-distributed subset of Pareto optimal solutions within the user-provided region(s), are extensively investigated in this paper. An empirical comparison is performed among three TMOEA instantiations: T-NSGA-II, T-SMS-EMOA and T-R2-EMOA. Experimental results show that T-SMS-EMOA has the best overall performance regarding the hypervolume indicator within the target region, while T-NSGA-II is the fastest algorithm. We also compare TMOEAs with other state-of-the-art preference. based approaches, i.e., DF-SMS-EMOA, RVEA, AS-EMOA and R-NSGA-II to show the advantages of TMOEAs. A case study in the mission planning of earth observation satellite is carried out to verify the capabilities of TMOEAs in the real-world application. Experimental results indicate that preferences can improve the searching ability of MOEAs, and TMOEAs can successfully find nondominated solutions preferred by the decision maker."

Placentas were examined for maternal and fetal inflammation. Infants were divided into deficient (10ng/ml) and adequate (>10ng/ml) groups based on 25OH D levels on day 1.Results: MeanSD maternal levels of 25OH D (21 +/- 9ng/ml) correlated with infants' levels (15 +/- 8ng/ml), (p<.001). 25OH D levels were lower in deficient (32/89) than in adequate group (8 +/- 2 versus 20 +/- 7ng/ml, p=.011). Infants' 25OH D levels rose significantly by day 21 (p<.001). Univariate analyses showed no differences between infant groups in maternal or fetal inflammation, or neonatal infections (p>.05). Logistic regression analyses revealed no association between deficient 25OH D levels and the odds of maternal or fetal inflammation or other infections. Levels of 25OH D did not correlate with severity of placental inflammation.Conclusions: Deficient levels of 25OH D at birth are not associated with the occurrence of placental inflammation or neonatal infections among VLBWI."
464904800001,PAMATKY ARCHEOLOGICKE,Settlement Strategies of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Societies in north Moravia and Czech Silesia (Czech Republic),"The study of settlement strategies enables us to uncover the dynamic aspects of the behaviour of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic populations. Geographic information systems facilitate the identification of relationships between landscape geomorphology and the preferences of humans during various phases of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene. In instances of larger geographic units, it is necessary to define smaller regions. apply objective criteria to describe their variability and uncover the potential humans could have used. It is important to elucidate the criteria that had a bearing on settlement strategies. An important region relevant for Palaeolithic Europe is the Moravian Gate that connected the Danube area with the regions of the North European Plain. There are several settlement units in north Moravia and Czech Silesia that can be identified on the basis of the site network. Despite the greatly heterogeneous character of archaeological data, it is possible to describe different settlement strategies that reflect both the changes in the ecosystem and the cultural traditions. Our knowledge of the Lower Palaeolithic and the early phase of the Middle Palaeolithic is rather fragmentary, and we are unable to define any settlement strategies. The situation at the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition is also complicated, since the sites do not form any distinctive cluster, and the prevalence of surface sites makes a clear cultural classification of the sites comprising mixed attributes impossible. In contrast, for the Gravettian, the Epigravettian, and the late phase of the Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic, clear preferences in the use of landscape can be observed."
427019400005,CHEMICAL RECORD,Changing Perspectives on the Strategic Use of Microwave Heating in Organic Synthesis,"This Personal Account describes collaborative investigations into apocryphal microwave effects in organic chemistry. Focused research on microwave-assisted organic synthesis has been fraught with confusion, controversy, and misinformation. Microwave heating is an undoubtedly useful tactic for organic synthesis, but whether or not it can offer strategic advantages remains an open question in the minds of many people. (Ironically, those who do not consider it an open question are split as to whether it has been resolved affirmatively or negatively.) Our research in this area is guided by the hypothesis that microwave heating can alter reaction kinetics in ways distinct from what is observable under conventional heating. Here we provide a succinct record of the origins of our interests, our initial queries and associated controversies, and recent efforts to identify, quantify, and begin to leverage selective microwave heating for strategic advantage in organic synthesis."
448809300025,SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS,PERTURBATIONS OF TIME SHIFTS IN SIGNAL APPARITION,"In the field of exploration geophysics, the method known as ""signal apparition"" offers a different perspective on how to separate signals acquired from simultaneously fired seismic sources. The method uses a periodic sequence of small time shift variations to encode the different sources, and this choice leads to exact separation of signals in diamond-shaped regions of the frequency-wavenumber domain which are twice as large compared to those recovered by other methods. In this paper we investigate the signal apparition method's sensitivity to perturbations of the periodic time shift sequence. We model (measured or unknown) perturbations in a stochastic fashion and prove that the resulting inverse problem of separating the data is still well-posed, and we demonstrate the stability by numerical simulations on a finite-difference synthetic data set generated over a complex salt model."

We found that the electronic structure showed half-metallic ferromagnetic character with spin polarization of 100 % around the Fermi level. In addition, the minority-spin bands depicted a half-metallic ferromagnetic (HMF) gap and half-metallic (HM) gap. The improved HMF and HM gaps found with the TB-mBJ potential are higher than with the GGA-WC approximation. These large HM gaps make compounds promising candidates for use in spintronics applications."
449565300013,JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE,"Flexible polyurethane foam-based sandwich composites: Preparation and evaluation of thermal, acoustic, and electromagnetic properties","This study proposes producing sandwich composites that have functionalities in addition to good mechanical properties. Flexible polyurethane (FPU) foam is used as the core, whereas nonwoven fabrics are used as the top and bottom panels. The functionalities, including flame-retardant (FR) efficacy, acoustic absorption, and electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMSE), help in expanding the application fields. In this study, FR agent is added to FPU foam to form the core, while the low-melting point polyethylene terephthalate (LPET) nonwoven fabric with/without carbon fiber (CF) fabric is used as panels. One-step molding and hot pressing are used to make these materials into LPET/FPU and CF-LPET/FPU sandwich composites. The cell structure of the FPU foam is examined, after which the limit oxygen index (LOI), the compression modulus, and heat insulation efficacy of LPET/FPU sandwich composites are examined, thereby examine the influence of FR agent. The test results show that the mechanical properties of sandwich composites are dependent on the amount of FR agent. Using 50 wt %, FR agent provides LPET/FPU sandwich composites with an optimal LOI of 28. In addition, the combination of CF fabric further provides CF-LPET/FPU composite sandwich with the maximum acoustic absorption coefficient of 0.90376 and an optimal EMSE of 50 dB. The proposed sandwich composites have functionalities of FR efficacy, acoustic absorption, heat insulation, and EMSE and thus are qualified for protective partitions used in karaoke and kindergartens.

440449800042,MEASUREMENT,Quantitative trend fault diagnosis of a rolling bearing based on Sparsogram and Lempel-Ziv,"Aiming at the misdiagnosis caused by extracting the non-fault features using Lempel-Ziv algorithm, a quantitative trend fault diagnosis method of a rolling bearing based on Sparsogram and Lempel-Ziv is proposed in this paper. The approximate linear relationships between Lempel-Ziv and the fault sizes of inner and outer races are simulated with a theoretical model of rolling bearings. Then, the fault characteristic of experimental signal of bearing inner and outer race in different severity is extracted by Sparsogram algorithm, and the frequency band is selected which reflects the fault characteristic mostly, and the Lempel-Ziv complexity index of the frequency band is calculated. This method can avoid the misdiagnosis caused by extracting non-fault features. Comparing with direct calculation of Lempel-Ziv value, the performance is much better on the quantitative diagnosis of a defective bearing. The experimental results show that the proposed method can realize the quantitative trend diagnosis on defective bearings."
443923500046,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C,Developing Distinct Chemical Environments in Ionic Liquid Films,"We report the reversible transitions from two distinct chemical environments (interfacial and bulk) to a single, globally ordered dominant environment that extends to 800 nm, within two triflate-based ionic liquid (IL) films. Vibrational spectra for supported IL films exhibit multiple peaks for the same vibrational mode, indicating the presence of multiple chemical environments (interfacial and bulk) in the film. After a quiescent maturation time, the vibrational spectra show much simpler absorption profiles indicating coalescence of the IL molecules into a global preferred phase, which resembles the interfacial environment that propagates throughout the film as a function of time. Data analysis suggests significant reorientation of the triflate anion with small changes of the cation, indicating a weakly interacting cation-anion pair. The distal extent of the self-organization is much thicker than that generally reported for solid-fluid interfaces. The ordering is reversible on replenishing the film with fresh fluid. This report, describing propagation of interfacial molecular orientation to form extended ordered structures, is a motivation for future studies to apply this phenomenon toward the thoughtful design of new IL systems for use in materials and devices."
447366100009,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,Interdecadal variability of the ENSO teleconnection to the wintertime North Pacific,"The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strongly influences the large-scale atmospheric circulation over the extratropical North Pacific during boreal winter, which has an important impact on North American winter climate. This study analyses the interdecadal variability of the ENSO teleconnection to the wintertime extratropical North Pacific, over the period 1900-2010, using a range of observationally derived datasets and an ensemble of atmospheric model simulations. The observed teleconnection strength is found to vary substantially over the 20th century. Specifically, 31-year periods in the early-century (1912-1942), mid-century (1946-1976) and the late-century (1980-2010) are identified in the observations when the ENSO teleconnection to the North Pacific circulation are found to be particularly strong, weak and strong respectively. The ENSO teleconnection to the North Pacific in the atmospheric model ensemble is weak in the mid-century period and substantially stronger in the late-century, closely following the variability in the observed ENSO-North Pacific teleconnection. In the early-century, however, the atmospheric model also exhibits a weak teleconnection to the North Pacific, unlike in observations. In a subset of the model realisations that exhibit similar ENSO-North Pacific teleconnection as in observations during the early-century period there are large differences in extratropical circulation but not in equatorial Pacific precipitation anomalies, in contrast to the late-century period. This suggests that the high correlation in the early century period is largely due to internal extratropical variability. The important implications of these results for seasonal predictability and the assessment of seasonal forecasting systems are discussed."

Concretely speaking, aberrant driving behaviors would cause more accidents, and oppositely positive driving behaviors would promote to build safety traffic environment. The main goals of this study were to explore the positive driving behavior and its relationship with personality in a Chinese sample. A total of 421 licensed drivers (286 male and 135 female) from Beijing, China completed the Positive Driver Behavior Scale (PDBS), the Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ), the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) on a voluntary and anonymous basis. The results showed that the Chinese version of the PDBS has both reliability and validity and that the PDBS was significantly correlated with the BFI. Specifically, the PDBS was negatively correlated with neuroticism (r = -0.38) and positively correlated with extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience (the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.36 to 0.55). In contrast with previous research, age was negatively correlated with the PDBS (r = -0.38) in our sample, which may have resulted from less driving experience or a lack of available cognitive resources."

A behavioral screen on five importin a knockout lines revealed that reduced expression of importin alpha 5 (KPNA1) in hippocampal neurons specifically decreases anxiety in mice. Re-expression of importin alpha 5 in ventral hip-pocampus of knockout animals increased anxiety behaviors to wild-type levels. Hippocampal neurons lacking importin alpha 5 reveal changes in presynaptic plasticity and modified expression of MeCP2-regulated genes, including sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1). Knockout of importin alpha 5, but not importin alpha 3 or alpha 4, reduces MeCP2 nuclear localization in hippocampal neurons. A Sphk1 blocker reverses anxiolysis in the importin alpha 5 knockout mouse, while pharmacological activation of sphingosine signaling has robust anxiolytic effects in wild-type animals. Thus, importin alpha 5 influences sphingosine-sensitive anxiety pathways by regulating MeCP2 nuclear import in hippocampal neurons."
419406700025,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Early flowering and rapid grain filling determine early maturity and escape from harvesting in weedy rice,"BACKGROUNDEarly maturity is an important trait that is essential to the survival of weedy rice. To explore the mechanism of early maturity in weedy rice, the reproductive development of a large sample of weedy rice accessions and cultivars was compared in a common garden study. A selected sample of both weedy and cultivated rice was sown at different dates in two years to study in more detail their flowering and grain-filling patterns. RESULTSThe weedy rice from three major cropping regions matured 7-8 days earlier than their associated cultivars. Representative weedy rice accessions planted on conventional sowing dates flowered 3-26 days earlier than cultivars; delayed sowing caused divergence in the flowering regimes in weedy rice. However, regardless of the sowing date, weedy rice filled its grain 7-21 days faster than cultivars in both study years. Vegetative and reproductive traits of weedy and cultivated rice have different patterns of variation with delayed planting. CONCLUSIONEarly maturity is an essential factor determining the persistence of weedy rice by contributing to the escape of its seed from being harvested with the rice crop. Both early flowering and shorter grain-filling stages determine early maturity, and flowering is more plastic than grain filling. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry"
428990200109,OPTICS EXPRESS,Phase measurement by using a forced delay-line oscillator and its application for an acoustic fiber sensor,"We demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, a new method to measure small changes in the cavity length of oscillators. The method is based on the high sensitivity of the phase of forced delay-line oscillators to changes in their cavity length. The oscillator phase is directly detected by mixing the oscillator output with the injected signal. We describe a comprehensive theoretical model for studying the signal and the noise at the output of a general forced delay-line oscillator with an instantaneous gain saturation and an amplitude-to-phase conversion. The results indicate that the magnitude and the bandwidth of the oscillator response to a small perturbation can be controlled by adjusting the injection ratio and the injected frequency. For signals with a frequency that is smaller than the device bandwidth, the oscillator noise is dominated by the noise of the injected signal. This noise is highly suppressed by mixing the oscillator output with the injected signal. Hence, the device sensitivity at frequencies below its bandwidth is limited only by the internal noise that is added in a single roundtrip in the oscillator cavity. We demonstrate the use of a forced oscillator as an acoustic fiber sensor in an optoelectronic oscillator. A good agreement is obtained between theory and experiments. The magnitude of the output signal can be controlled by adjusting the injection ratio while the noise power at low frequencies is not enhanced as in sensors that are based on a free-running oscillator.

445419900007,GOSPODARKA SUROWCAMI MINERALNYMI-MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Ore value chain modeling and cost analysis based on Petri nets,"At present, with the increase of production capacity and the promotion of production, the reserves of most mining enterprises under the original industrial indexes are rapidly consumed, and the full use of low-grade resources is getting more and more attention. If mining enterprises want to make full use of low-grade resources simultaneously and obtain good economic benefits to strengthening the analysis and management of costs is necessary. For metal underground mines, with the gradual implementation of exploration and mining projects, capital investment and labor consumption are dynamic and increase cumulatively in stages. Consequently, in the evaluation of ore value, we should proceed from a series of processes such as: exploration, mining, processing and the smelting of geological resources, and then study the resources increment in different stages of production and the processing. To achieve a phased assessment of the ore value and fine evaluation of the cost, based on the value chain theory and referring to the modeling method of computer integrated manufacturing open system architecture (CIMOSA), the analysis framework of gold mining enterprise value chain is established based on the value chain theory from the three dimensions of value-added activities, value subjects and value carriers. A value chain model using ore flow as the carrying body is built based on Petri nets. With the CPN Tools emulation tool, the cycle simulation of the model is carry out by the colored Petri nets, which contain a hierarchical structure. Taking a large-scale gold mining enterprise as an example, the value chain model is quantified to simulate the ore value formation, flow, transmission and implementation process. By analyzing the results of the simulation, the ore value at different production stages is evaluated dynamically, and the cost is similarly analyzed in stages, which can improve mining enterprise cost management, promote the application of computer modeling and simulation technology in mine engineering, more accurately evaluate the economic feasibility of ore utilization, and provide the basis for the value evaluation and elective utilization of low-grade ores."

However, the proposed changes continue to focus entirely on the individual and fail to take into account the rapidly-emerging types of research that involve patients and communities directly in the research process. Purpose of Article: We propose several changes and amendments that address the interests of communities and underscore the principle of justice, especially social justice. Key Points: Our recommendations seek to revise human subjects' protections that currently overemphasize individualism and autonomy to reflect a collectivist ethos that would extend protections to communities engaged in medical research. Conclusion: We believe this is necessary to effectively and efficiently conduct the types of research that will ultimately rectify health inequities that continue to exist in many communities, but particularly communities of color."
454268900040,EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES-THEORY & PRACTICE,Effect Channels of Education Level and Cognitive Skill on Economic Growth,"This paper aims to disclose the direct and indirect effect channels of education level and cognitive skill on economic growth. For this purpose, the effective education was introduced to analyse the provincial panel data in 1996 similar to 2012 against three levels of education in China: compulsory education, senior high school education and higher education. The education level and cognitive skill were treated as components of heterogeneous human capital. The empirical analysis shows that: On the compulsory education level, neither educated populated nor cognitive skill has any direct or indirect impact on economic growth. On the level of senior high school education, the education level has a significant positive effect on economic growth indirectly through innovation imitation. On the higher education level, the human capital exerts a greater positive effect on economic growth directly as a production input than that of compulsory and senior high school educations. The research findings shed new light on the improvement of economic growth through human capital accumulation at different education levels."

Over the years 1938 to 1945, political-ideological motives increase while unpolitical-scientific reasons decrease. The results show how deeply agronomic research was involved in the Nazi regime."
433957900014,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS,Incremental Perspective for Feature Selection Based on Fuzzy Rough Sets,"Feature selection based on fuzzy rough sets is an effective approach to select a compact feature subset that optimally predicts a given decision label. Despite being studied extensively, most existing methods of fuzzy rough set based feature selection are restricted to computing the whole dataset in batch, which is often costly or even intractable for large datasets. To improve the time efficiency, we investigate the incremental perspective for fuzzy rough set based feature selection assuming data can be presented in sample subsets one after another. The key challenge for the incremental perspective is how to add and delete features with the subsequent arrival of sample subsets. We tackle this challenge with strategies of adding and deleting features based on the relative discernibility relations that are updated as subsets arrive sequentially. Two incremental algorithms for fuzzy rough set based feature selection are designed based on the strategies. One updates the selected features as each sample subset arrives, and outputs the final feature subset where no sample subset is left. The other updates the relative discernibility relations but only performs feature selection where there is no further subset arriving. Experimental comparisons suggest our incremental algorithms expedite fuzzy rough set based feature selection without compromising performance."
427435600005,COSTUME-THE JOURNAL OF THE COSTUME SOCIETY,'A well-dressed actress': Exploring the Theatrical Wardrobe of Ellen Terry,"A leading actress of the late nineteenth century, Dame Ellen Terry (1847-1928) exercised an unusual degree of control over her theatre costumes and played an active role in the design and creation of these garments. Drawing upon evidence gathered from a wide range of material culture sources, most notably her surviving costumes, this article considers the theatrical, historical, social and artistic context which shaped Terry's theatrical performances and stage dress. Terry's theatre costumes also reflected her personal views on dress, both on and off the stage. Particular attention will therefore be paid to the changes which occurred in Terry's stage dress as her increasing fame and financial independence enabled her to achieve greater control over the design and, importantly, the designers, of her theatre costumes. Through a close analysis of key pieces from Terry's stage wardrobe, this article will draw attention to the important part her theatre costumes played in a wider process of self-fashioning in which Terry used her dress, both on and off the stage, to establish her status as an 'Icon of Aestheticism' and secure her enduring legacy as an actress who understood the 'art' of theatre."

450297400008,BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,Lasting Impact on Memory of Midlife Exposure to Exogenous and Endogenous Estrogens,"We previously demonstrated that 40 days of prior midlife estradiol treatment results in enhanced spatial memory in aging ovariectomized rats long after termination of the estradiol treatment. Our current goal was to determine whether this benefit is due to lasting impacts on memory specifically of previous exogenous estradiol treatment or simply due to delaying cognitive deficits that occur following loss of ovarian hormones. Middle-aged rats were ovariectomized or underwent sham surgery. Ovariectomized rats received estradiol (Previous Estradiol) or vehicle (Previous Vehicle) implants. Rats undergoing sham surgery (Previous Intact) received vehicle implants. Forty days later, Previous Intact rats were ovariectomized, the other 2 groups underwent sham surgeries, and all implants were removed. Thus, no ovarian or exogenously administered hormones were present during behavior testing. Rats underwent 24 days of acquisition training on an 8-arm radial maze. Following acquisition and again 2 months later, rats were tested on delay trials, during which animals had to remember the location of food rewards across time delays inserted between fourth and fifth arm choices. During acquisition, rats that had previous extended exposure to exogenous estradiol (Previous Estradiol) and endogenous ovarian hormones (Previous Intact) significantly outperformed rats that did not experience extended hormone exposure (Previous Vehicle). However, during delays trials the Previous Estradiol group significantly outperformed both the Previous Vehicle and Previous Intact groups. Results demonstrate that whereas extended exposure to endogenous ovarian hormones may provide short-term cognitive benefits, midlife estradiol treatment following ovariectomy provides additional benefits that persist for months following termination of treatment."
424082000002,MEDICINE,Repair of deep tissue defects in the posterior talocrural region using a superficial temporal fascia free flap plus thin split-skin grafting in extensively burned patients A retrospective case series,"The aim of this study was to describe the scheme, surgical procedures, and clinical outcomes for the early repair of deep wounds of the posterior talocrural region in extensively burned patients with a method combining a superficial temporal fascia free flap with thin split-skin grafting. From January 2013 to February 2016, 9 extensively burned patients with deep tissue defects of the posterior talocrural region were treated in our department (2 patients had bilateral deep tissue defects of the posterior talocrural region). All 11 wounds were repaired using a superficial temporal fascia free flap and thin split-skin grafting. After the operation, survival of the fascia flaps and grafted skin was observed, and the appearance and functional recovery of the grafts were evaluated. Follow-up information was reviewed, and complications were documented. All 11 fascia flaps survived completely. Two cases of partial skin necrosis healed after the second application of skin grafts. The appearance and function of recipient sites were well restored in all patients over a follow-up period of 5 to 14 months. Deep tissue defects of the posterior talocrural region can be effectively repaired with our method combining a superficial temporal fascia free flap with thin split-skin grafting. This method offers the advantages of a good appearance, strong resistance to infection, minimal damage at the donor site, short course of disease, and good prognosis."
440055500003,DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS,Meaning of working and expectations: a research on professional soldier candidates in Turkey,"Previous studies on the relationship between individual's enlistment decisions and their personal characteristics examined a number of variables such as age, marital status, gender, family background, geographical background, employment situation and education level. However, attitudes towards working, expectations from a good job and centrality of working are also important determinants in this process. This paper examines the profile of juveniles who seek a career as gendarmerie non-commissioned officers (NCO) in the Turkish Armed Forces and their attitudes and expectations towards working in general within the framework of Meaning of Working (MOW) researches. According to the results of the survey conducted with 500 NCO candidates in Turkey, learning something new, good relations with colleagues and employment guarantee are detected as the main expectations of juveniles who seek a career in military. Results also show that having a job is so important for these young people that they consider having a job even prior to their families."
451814000016,ENERGIES,Guidelines for Optimal Selection of Subcritical Low-Temperature Geothermal Organic Rankine Cycle Configuration Considering Reinjection Temperature Limits,"General guidelines are proposed to select the optimal subcritical organic Rankine cycle configuration considering reinjection temperature limits for a low-temperature geothermal brine power plant. Saturated/superheated, non-regenerative/regenerative cycles are investigated. Evaporating temperature and overheating degree at the turbine inlet are selected as design variables, and highest plant exergy efficiency is pursued for current optimizations. Through theoretical analysis of mathematical modelling and typical case studies, a simple optimization approach is presented. The new approach consists of up to three judgements on reinjection temperature and evaporating temperature in comparison two optimization calculations along the saturated line and along the given reinjection temperature line. The potential optimal cycle configurations are saturated non-regenerative cycle, saturated regenerative cycle and superheated regenerative cycle. Then, this new optimization approach is applied to obtain optimal cycle configuration and relevant working condition. The working fluids investigated are R245fa, R1234ze(Z), isopentane, and isobutane. The saturated non-regenerative cycle is the optimal cycle when the reinjection temperature limit is equal or less than the optimal reinjection temperature with no reinjection constraint. Otherwise, the reinjection temperature limit influences not only the optimal cycle configuration but also the optimal working condition. Working fluid isobutane always achieves highest plant exergy efficiency for optimal cycles with either reinjection temperature limit."
427567700004,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL LABORATORY ANALYSIS,Anti-ENA antibody profiles in patients with hepatitis C virus infection,"BackgroundThe presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) has been described following hepatitis C virus (HCV). Very few studies have investigated the presence of anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) in HCV infection. MethodsThe aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of ENA antibodies in 100 patients with HCV infection compared to the prevalence of ENA antibodies in 100 healthy control patients. Sera from patients were tested for ENA using a multiplex microbead immunoassay. Sera positive for ENA were subsequently tested for ANA using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and titered if positive. ResultsFourteen (14%) of the 100 patients with HCV infection had anti-ENA antibodies: four each showed anti-SSA antibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies, three each had RNP antibodies and Scl-70 antibodies, and one each had anti-SSB, centromere B, Sm, and Sm/RNP antibodies. Ten of the 14 patients positive for anti-ENA were positive by indirect immunofluorescence staining (IFA) with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:160. Five had antinuclear patterns, one had combined antinuclear and cytoplasmic patterns, and four only had a cytoplasmic pattern. Three of the 100 healthy control patients had ANA positive titers (1:80 and 1:320) and anti-ENA antibodies: one anti-Scl-70 and two anti-RNP. ConclusionThe prevalence of anti-ENA antibodies was significantly higher in the patients with HCV infections than in the healthy controls. Other studies of anti-ENA profiles in patients with HCV infection have identified similar patterns of positivity for anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-dsDNA, anti-RNP, anti- Sm/RNP, Scl-70, centromere B, and anti-Sm."
419695100001,BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,The Fluid Dynamical Performance of the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease Prosthesis,"The aim of the present in vitro study was the evaluation of the fluid dynamical performance of the Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Magna Ease depending on the prosthetic size (21, 23, and 25 mm) and the cardiac output (3.6-6.4 L/min). A self-constructed flow channel in combination with particle image velocimetry (PIV) enabled precise results with high reproducibility, focus on maximal and local peek velocities, strain, and velocity gradients. These flow parameters allow insights into the generation of forces that act on blood cells and the aorticwall. The results showed that the 21 and 23 mm valves have a quite similar performance. Maximal velocities were 3.03 +/- 0.1 and 2.87 +/- 0.13 m/s; maximal strain E-xx, 913.81 +/- 173.25 and 896.15 +/- 88.16 1/s; maximal velocity gradient E-yx, 1203.14 +/- 221.84 1/s and 1200.81 +/- 61.83 1/s. The 25 mm size revealed significantly lower values: maximal velocity, 2.47 +/- 0.15 m/s; maximal strain E-xx , 592.98 +/- 155.80 1/s; maximal velocity gradient E-yx , 823.71 +/- 38.64 1/s. In summary, the 25 mm Magna Ease was able to create a wider, more homogenous flow with lower peak velocities especially for higher flow rates. Despite the wider flow, the velocity values close to the aortic walls did not exceed the level of the smaller valves."
436020700010,ANNALS OF CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY,An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method for relative free copper determination and generation of a paediatric reference interval,"Background: Diagnosis of Wilson's disease is currently performed using caeruloplasmin as a first-line screening test; however, this test has well-described limitations. Monitoring of known Wilson's disease patients often uses 24-h urine collection; however, this is inaccurate in children. Methods for directly measuring plasma free copper have been described, but no reference interval data exist for a paediatric population. Methods: An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method for measuring free copper was developed and validated, using ultracentrifugation. A paediatric reference interval was generated using 85 plasma samples from children attending outpatient clinics at University Hospital Southampton. Results: Results showed no significant contamination of copper using the ultracentrifugation technique, and validation showed the method was accurate and precise with an analytical coefficient of variation between 5 and 7% depending on the concentration of free copper. Conclusions: We describe the use and validation of an ultrafiltration inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method for plasma free copper with the first published paediatric reference interval. Free copper could provide much needed assistance for the monitoring of Wilson's disease in children and also for adults."
430193600001,BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH,"Exploratory field study on the effect of Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) sow vaccination on serological, virological and reproductive parameters in a PCV2 subclinically infected sow herd","Background: This study sought to evaluate the effect of sow vaccination against Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) on reproductive parameters during two consecutive reproductive cycles. The study was performed in a PCV2 subclinical infected breeding herd (PCV2 circulation but absence of major reproductive problems). Ninety-four pregnant sows were primo-immunized with a commercial PCV2 vaccine and ninety-seven were injected with phosphate-buffered saline at 6 and 3 weeks before the first studied farrowing, and then boosted at 2 weeks before the second one. Blood samples were taken throughout the study to assess PCV2 DNA load and antibodies. At farrowing, main reproductive parameters and piglet vitality index were registered. In addition, in those litters with more than three mummified or stillborn piglets, microscopic examination and PCV2 antigen detection in foetal myocardium was done. Results: Vaccinated sows showed significantly higher antibody levels compared to the non-vaccinated counterparts. PCV2 DNA was only detected at farrowing in 2 (4.2%) non-vaccinated sows. Vaccinated sows had 1.3 more live-born piglets per litter at the second cycle than non-vaccinated counterparts. Piglets from vaccinated sows had significantly higher (+ 12.7%) vitality score than the ones born from non-vaccinated sows. No PCV2 compatible lesions neither PCV2 antigen were detected in the tested foetal hearts. Conclusions: The present study represents a first attempt to demonstrate that PCV2 sow vaccination may have a positive influence on prolificacy and vitality of the offspring in a subclinical infected breeding herd. However, since reproductive outcomes at farm level may be affected by a number of factors, further studies would be needed to confirm this association."
435949100016,DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES,Health Maintenance Documentation Improves for Veterans with IBD Using a Template in the Computerized Patient Record System,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and the therapies used to treat these conditions can lead to preventable complications. In 2011, AGA developed the Adult IBD Physician Performance Measures Set to improve accountability and performance management in IBD care; however, compliance remains poor. The aim of this study is to assess for an improvement in provider compliance with the recommended outpatient preventive care measures in our VA IBD patients after July 2014 following the implementation of a health maintenance template in the Computerized Patient Record system (CPRS). We conducted a single-center, retrospective chart review of 139 IBD patients with at least one visit before and after the implementation of the health maintenance template through November 2016. We collected demographic data, immunosuppressive medication use, and recommendations for preventive care. For each variable analyzed, we included those patients where the preventive care measure was indicated based on age, gender, and/or medication use. The McNemar's test for paired nominal data was used to assess the significant difference in recommendation rate, pre- versus post-template implementation. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. We included 139 patients (46% with Crohn's disease, 53% with ulcerative colitis, 1% with indeterminate colitis) in the analysis. Seventy-eight (56%) patients were on immunosuppressants. All preventive care measures significantly improved after implementation of the CPRS template except for HPV vaccination. Implementing a health maintenance template in outpatient GI clinic notes significantly improved provider documentation of the recommended outpatient preventive care in our VA IBD population."
445328900019,CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION,Influence of pretransplant midodrine use on outcomes after kidney transplantation,"Evaluation of potential kidney transplant recipients is important to identify and treat conditions that may influence graft or patient survival after transplantation. We performed a single-center, observational cohort study to determine whether pretransplant midodrine use influences outcomes after kidney transplantation. We analyzed graft and patient outcomes for adult patients who underwent a kidney-only transplantation at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from January 1999 to December 2015. We quantified adjusted associations of pretransplant midodrine use with post-transplant complications by multivariable Cox regression. Among the 2621 kidney transplant recipients analyzed, 37 (1.4%) were taking midodrine immediately prior to transplantation. Midodrine users were more commonly older (56.5 vs 50.4 years) and obese (67.6% vs 33.6%). Midodrine users were also more likely to be on hemodialysis (86.5% vs 59.2%), to have a longer duration of dialysis dependence (646 months vs 577 months), and to have higher levels of sensitization (peak panel reactive antibody >20%, 32.4% vs 15.8%) compared to nonusers. Pretransplant midodrine users had significantly higher rates of delayed graft function (DGF) (32.4% vs 6.7%, P < 0.001). No difference in the incidence of DGF was observed based on the midodrine dosing regimen. After multivariable adjustment for recipient and donor characteristics, pretransplant midodrine use was independently associated with graft failure at 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.11; 95% confidence interval, 2.09-12.49)."
429777600012,CLINICAL REHABILITATION,"The impact of self-perceived limitations, stigma and sense of coherence on quality of life in multiple sclerosis patients: results of a cross-sectional study","Objective: To examine the impact of perceived limitations, stigma and sense of coherence on quality of life in multiple sclerosis patients. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands. Subjects: Multiple sclerosis patients. Main measures: World Health Organization Quality of Life - abbreviated version, Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness, Sense of Coherence Scale, background and disease-related questions. Results: In total, 185 patients (61% response rate) participated in the study with moderate to severe limitations. Stigma was highly prevalent but low in severity. Patients with a higher sense of coherence experienced a lower level of limitations (B = -0.063, P < 0.01) and less stigma (enacted stigma B = -0.030, P < 0.01; self-stigma B = -0.037, P < 0.01). Patients with a higher level of limitations experienced more stigma (enacted stigma B = 0.044, P < 0.05; self-stigma B = 0.063, P < 0.01). Patients with a higher sense of coherence experienced better quality of life (physical health B = 0.059, P < 0.01; psychological health B = 0.062, P < 0.01; social relationships B = 0.052, P < 0.01; environmental aspects B = 0.030, P < 0.01). Patients with a higher level of limitations experienced poorer quality of life (physical health B= -0.364, P < 0.01; psychological health B = -0.089, P< 0.05) and patients with more stigma also experienced poorer quality of life (self-stigma: physical health B = -0.073, P < 0.01; psychological health B = -0.089, P < 0.01; social relationships B = -0.124, P < 0.01; environmental aspects B = -0.052, P < 0.01, and enacted stigma: physical health B = -0.085, P < 0.10). Conclusion: Patients with less perceived limitations and stigma and a higher level of sense of coherence experienced better quality of life. Patients with a higher sense of coherence experienced a lower level of limitations and less stigma."
448461100003,PSYCHOTHERAPIE PSYCHOSOMATIK MEDIZINISCHE PSYCHOLOGIE,Living with Localized Prostate Cancer - Decision-Making and Coping with the Illness,"Background Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer must make a choice between treatment strategies that differ considerably in their side effects and have different long-term requirements for coping with the disease. The aim of this study was to describe how men perceive their treatment decision retrospectively and which coping strategies they use. Material & Methods Fifteen men (age mean=67.139.38 years) diagnosed with localized prostate cancer participated in three focus groups, grouped according to the treatment strategies radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and active surveillance. An interview guide structured the focus group discussions. In analogy to the structured interview, the material was deductively sorted in a first step; in a second step, sub-categories were developed inductively from the material. Results The content analysis revealed four particularly relevant topics: (1) The communication of the diagnosis and the associated reactions. (2) The decision-making process and the perceived time pressure. (3) The coping strategies, which showed a broad spectrum ranging from distraction and information search to lifestyle changes. (4) The perception of the disease over time. In particular men under active surveillance highlighted the importance of deceleration in their decision making and the role of lifestyle changes. Discussion The time of the diagnosis is still very much present even a long time after the diagnosis has been communicated. It is possible that a decrease in time pressure and deceleration would lead to more men deciding in favor of an observational strategy. Lifestyle changes could especially help men who choose active surveillance to overcome the feeling of doing nothing and gain a sense of control. Conclusion In view of the variety of possible treatment strategies, an ethic of action is required that meets the need for an individual and preference-sensitive decision."
442699900047,JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS,Development of a disposable electrochemical sensor for detection of cholesterol using differential pulse voltammetry,"In this study, a sensitive and selective electrochemical sensor was fabricated by usinga screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) for detecting cholesterol. MWCNTs were functionalized with benzoic acid moiety by employing diazonium salt chemistry, and, subsequently, a thin film of functionalized CNTs were coated on the surface of SPCE. Afterwards, beta-CD was immobilized on functionalized MWCNTs modified SPCE which acts as a host to recognize guest (cholesterol) molecule specifically. Under the optimal experimental conditions and using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) as transduction technique the sensor was able to detect cholesterol level ranges from 1 nM to 3 mu M, with a detection limit of 0.5 nM. Specificity of the developed sensor towards target analyte (cholesterol) was confirmed in the presence of common interfering species including glucose, uric acid and ascorbic acid. The applicability of proposed sensor was also demonstrated for cholesterol determination in human serum samples with good recovery results (94-96%) and maximum RSD (relative standard deviation) of 4.5%.

425202600006,INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE & EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES,"Internal and external factors affecting the crystallization, gelation and applicability of wax-based oleogels in food industry","In recent years, wax-based oleogelation has appeared as a new and effective strategy to structure liquid oil into soft, solid-like systems, which can be exploited as alternatives for trans- and/or saturated lipidic hardstocks in the production of lipid-based food products. Waxes are crystalline gelators, consisting of a mixture of straight chain alkanes, long-chain fatty acids, long-chain fatty alcohols, wax esters, aldehydes, ketones, glycerol esters or di-esters. Wax-based gelation arises from the crystallization of wax particles. Tuning the preparation conditions such as cooling rate, shear rate and setting temperature can alter the crystallization and gelation of natural waxes in liquid oil. A better fundamental understanding on wax-based oleogelation is therefore important to control the quality of food products, in which these oleogels could act as structuring agents. In the food industry, wax-based oleogels can be utilized to partially or fully replace the trans- and/or saturated fats in fat-based food formulations such as shortening, margarine, confectionery products, ice-cream, and whipped-cream. Furthermore, oil migration can be prevented by using wax crystals to capture the free liquid oil within a fat based confectionery filling. The scope of this review is to provide a concise insight into structuring liquid oil using natural waxes, with the emphasis on different internal and external factors affecting the physicochemical properties of wax-based oleogels. The innovative food applications of wax-based oleogels are also discussed in details. Industrial relevance: Wax-based oleogelation has been emerged as a potential alternative to conventional oil structuring. The gelling behavior of natural waxes in liquid oils is governed by the polarity of the solvents, and by the wax crystal morphologies, which are determined by the nature and chain length of the chemical components present in waxes. In addition, the gelling behavior of wax-based oleogels can be tuned by altering the cooling and shear rates, and by changing the time and temperature of cooling. These factors strongly influence the physicochemical properties as well as the storage stability of wax-based oleogels. In addition, the application of wax-based oleogel in food formulations has encountered some technical challenges due to the incompatibility between oleogels and saturated fats, and due to the insufficient amount of solid content provided by waxes. With regard to the sensorial aspect, the waxy mouthfeel might be an obstacle restricting the acceptance of wax-based products in food markets. This review therefore provides a concise overview relating to the internal (chemical composition of natural waxes, type and polarity of solvents) and external factors (cooling rate, shear rate, storage time, and co-structuring) affecting the crystallization and gelation of wax-based oleogels, as well as their potential application in producing low-saturated fat products in food industry."
438972600012,AMERICAN NATURALIST,The Role of Phenotypic Plasticity in Moderating Evolutionary Conflict,"Evolutionary conflicts arise when the fitness interests of interacting individuals differ. Well-known examples include sexual conflict between males and females and antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites. A common feature of such conflicts is that compensating evolutionary change in each of the parties can lead to little overt change in the interaction itself. As a result, evolutionary conflict is expected to persist even if the evolutionary dynamic between the parties reaches an equilibrium. In these cases, it is of interest to know whether certain kinds of interactions are expected to lead to greater or lesser evolutionary conflict at such evolutionary stalemates. Here we present a theoretical analysis showing that when one of the interacting parties can respond to the other through adaptive phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary conflict is reduced. Paradoxically, however, it is the party that does not express adaptive plasticity that experiences less conflict. Conflict for the party displaying adaptive plasticity can increase or decrease, depending on the situation."

We emphasized on synthesis of flavones derivatives with imidazole (2a, 2b, 2c) and triazole (3a, 3b, 3c) nucleus as a fundamental hetero-aromatic system with modifications, which have been confirmed by TLC, IR, NMR and mass spectrometry data. The synthesized compound were studied as non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors and evaluated for in vitro anti-breast cancer activity against MCF-7 cell line through SRB assay. The triazole derivative 3a with nitro substitution (H-bond accepting group) was found to be more active in comparison to standard drug letrozole."
456946200002,ASIA-PACIFIC PSYCHIATRY,The prevalence and psychosocial risk factors for psychotic-like experiences (PLE) among high school students in Jakarta,"Introduction: The prevalence of psychotic-like experiences (PLE) in general population is moderately high (5%-8%), although the prevalence of psychotic disorder is considerably low (< 1%). Amid the urgency to understand the underlying factors of psychotic disorder and PLE, most research tend to focus on genetic factors. However, numerous recent works suggested increasing importance of non-genetic factors. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of PLE and any psychosocial variables that contribute to any occurrence of PLE among adolescent in Jakarta. Methods: This is a school based cross-sectional study that was carried out in early 2017. A total sample of 623 high school students from five schools in Jakarta were selected by using multistage random sampling. Psychotic experience was measured using Psychotic-Like Experiences Questionnaire. Multiple psychosocial variables proposed as predictor model for PLE were examined using multivariate regression. Results: Our final result showed 20.6% prevalence of PLE among high school students in Jakarta. The proposed psychosocial risk model (consisting of violence exposure, parental communication pattern, peer and conduct problems, social comparison, parental attachment, loneliness, and bullying) contributed to explain 16.3% of the occurrence of PLE (R square: .163). Discussion: The prevalence of PLE in this population was considerably high. Cultural factors such as paranormal beliefs are assumed to contribute to the high prevalence of PLE among high school students. The quite low contribution score of psychosocial model proposed in predicting the phenomenon of PLE shows that further research is needed to explore more variables that can be better predictors of PLE."
436110900004,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,Pharmacological modulation of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in a mouse model of mecamylamine-precipitated nicotine withdrawal,"Recent preclinical data has implicated the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) as a target in modulating nicotine reward. However, the role of the channel properties of the alpha 7 nAChR in nicotine withdrawal is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the impact of alpha 7 nAChR pharmacological modulation on mecamylamine-precipitated nicotine withdrawal behaviors in mice by using positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). The effect of the orthosteric alpha 7 nAChR full agonist PNU282987 (1, 3, 9 mg/kg, s.c.), type I alpha 7 PAM NS1738 (1 and 10 mg/kg; i.p.) and the type II alpha 7 PAM PNU120596 (3 and 9 mg/kg, i.p.) on anxiety-like behavior, somatic signs, and hyperalgesia was measured in mice undergoing mecamylamine-precipitated nicotine withdrawal. Mice were infused with 24 mg/kg/day nicotine or saline for 14 days using s.c. osmotic minipumps. Nicotine withdrawal signs were precipitated upon administration of the non-selective nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (3.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Anxiety-like behavior in nicotine withdrawn mice was only attenuated by PNU282987 in a dose-related fashion. Somatic signs were reduced by PNU282987 and NS1738. PNU120596 was the only compound that reversed precipitated nicotine withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia. Taken together, our results suggest that modulation of the alpha 7 nAChR can play important roles in mecamylamine-precipitated nicotine withdrawal behaviors in mice. In addition, the effects of PAMs in this study suggest that endogenous acetylcholine/choline tone is sufficient to attenuate some aspects of precipitated nicotine withdrawal. These findings highlight a beneficial effect of using alpha 7 nAChR PAMs in some aspects of precipitated nicotine withdrawal."
439545600003,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,"Using a reservoir computer to learn chaotic attractors, with applications to chaos synchronization and cryptography","Using the machine learning approach known as reservoir computing, it is possible to train one dynamical system to emulate another. We show that such trained reservoir computers reproduce the properties of the attractor of the chaotic system sufficiently well to exhibit chaos synchronization. That is, the trained reservoir computer, weakly driven by the chaotic system, will synchronize with the chaotic system. Conversely, the chaotic system, weakly driven by a trained reservoir computer, will synchronize with the reservoir computer. We illustrate this behavior on the Mackey-Glass and Lorenz systems. We then show that trained reservoir computers can be used to crack chaos based cryptography and illustrate this on a chaos cryptosystem based on the Mackey-Glass system. We conclude by discussing why reservoir computers are so good at emulating chaotic systems."

This study analyzed daily PM10 concentration measurements and meteorological observations collected throughout 2016 at two medium sized cities in central Greece: Karpenisi and Lamia, aiming to identify the impact of stoves and fireplaces. PM10 data were also analyzed along with synoptic conditions and backward air mass trajectories in order to identify atmospheric circulation patterns related to smog episodes in the two cities. Low temperatures were proven to be a key element which was associated with an increment of PM(10 )levels in both cities, however more PM10 episodes were observed in the high altitude city of Karpenisi, due to the more intensive wood burning in residential heating devices. Stagnant anticyclonic conditions during cold seasons were associated with the generation of exceedances of the daily PM10 limit set by European Union regulations, due to the accumulation of emissions. Dust aerosol intrusions from the Sahara desert were also indicated whilst PM10 transportation from northern directions through Balkan Peninsula is also possible."
433268700031,MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL,Sequential coprecipitation and matrix removal for determination of cadmium impurities from multivitamin supplements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and method validation by isotope dilution analysis of SRM 3280 multivitamin/multielement tablets,"In this paper, we examined three different sequential coprecipitation schemes based on Mg(OH)(2) and CaF2 precipitation using triethylamine (TEA) and hydrofluoric acid (HF), respectively, for determination of cadmium (Cd) impurities from multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplements by isotope dilution (ID) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The schemes involved three-step coprecipitation with either TEA alone or in combination with HF and are designated as Scheme 1 (TEA-TEA-TEA), Scheme 2 (TEA-HF-TEA) and Scheme 3 (HF-TEA-TEA) according to the addition sequence of each reagent. Experiments were carried out with MVM solutions spiked with 60 mu g L-1 Cd from a multielement standard solution. All schemes provided quantitative separation of Cd from MVM matrix. Scheme I was the least effective in removal of interfering concomitant elements, molybdenum (Mo) and tin (Sn). Scheme 2 performed better for Sn, but failed in eliminating Mo. Scheme 3 was the most effective in eliminating both Mo and Sn. Mo levels in test MVM solutions reduced from 4.314 mu g mL(-1) to as low as 0.014 mu g mL(-1) while that for Sn decreased from 0.5 mu g mL(-1) to 0.018 mu g mL(-1) allowing interference-free determination of Cd to be achieved. Salt-matrix due to Mg, Ca, P and K along with the essential elements (Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn) levels was also reduced significantly. Reagent blanks from HF and TEA were insignificant (0.008 mu g mL(-1)) allowing a limit of detection of 0.004 mu g mL(-1) or 0.26 ng g(-1) Cd to be achieved (3 sigma; n = 6). The performance of the coprecipitation method (Scheme 3) was validated by determination of Cd in multivitamin/multielement tablets certified reference material (SRM 3280) by ID-ICP-MS. Experimental results (ng g(-1)) and recoveries were 78.8 +/- 4.7 (98.5%), 77.9 +/- 5.2 (97.4%) and 76.5 +/- 4.8 (95.6%) for Cd-110, Cd-111 and Cd-114 isotopes, respectively. Several commercial MVM supplements were analyzed using the method. Mean Cd concentration ranged from 21.4 ng g(-1) to 93.3 ng g(-1). These values are much lower than those reported to date for various MVM supplements by ICP-MS determinations without chemical separation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
456085500029,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,The Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme: evaluation of Edinburgh's reception arrangements,"Background During 2015 and 2016 a group of Syrian refugees were resettled in Edinburgh, Scotland under the United Kingdom Government Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the settling in arrangements for these refugees. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five Arabic interpreters who had worked extensively with these refugees. Interviews sought their impressions about what went well or was not successful. Interviews were transcribed and key themes extracted and analysed. Results Six themes emerged: 'first impressions', language skills, different healthcare systems, health of the refugees, relationships between the interpreters and refugees and support for the interpreters. Conclusions The welcoming arrangements went well and exceeded refugees' and interpreters' expectations. There was perhaps too much information given immediately and reinforcing details about various public services and facilities after a first few months would be worthwhile. The Syrians were unfamiliar with NHS structures and found lack of direct specialist access surprising. Problems were amplified by low English levels. A need for Arabic literacy classes was also identified. Interpreters were often used informally out-of-hours and a better system with first contact in Arabic should be established. Interpreters find this work particularly stressful and the provision of psychological support for them should be prioritized."
447854500066,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS,Weighted Quantization-Regularization in DNNs for Weight Memory Minimization Toward HW Implementation,"Deployment of deep neural networks on hardware platforms is often constrained by limited on-chip memory and computational power. The proposed weight quantization offers the possibility of optimizing weight memory alongside transforming the weights to hardware friendly data types. We apply dynamic fixed point (DFP) and power-of-two (Po2) quantization in conjunction with layer-wise precision scaling to minimize the weight memory. To alleviate accuracy degradation due to precision scaling, we employ quantization-aware fine-tuning. For fine-tuning, quantization-regularization (QR) and weighted QR are introduced to force the trained quantization by adding the distance of the weights to the desired quantization levels as a regularization term to the loss-function. While DFP quantization performs better when allowing different bit-widths for each layer, Po2 quantization in combination with retraining allows higher compression rates for equal bit-width quantization. The techniques are verified on an all-convolutional network. With accuracy degradation of 0.10% points, for DFP with layer-wise precision scaling we achieve compression ratios of 7.34 for CIFAR-10, 4.7 for CIFAR-100, and 9.33 for SVHN dataset."
431825900246,ONCOLOGY LETTERS,Global analysis of histone lysine acetylation and proteomic changes in EC109 cells treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor FK228,"FK228 is a selective inhibitor of histone deacetylases that exhibits marked antitumor activity in cancer cells and xenograft models. However, the effect of FK228 on the global profile of histone lysine acetylation and the proteome of EC109 cells remains poorly understood. The present study aimed at analyzing histone lysine acetylation and identifying the proteomic changes in EC109 cells following treatment with FK228, using the stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture technique and a high-sensitivity mass spectrometer. In total, 87 acetylation sites and 3,515 proteins revealed changes in response to FK228 treatment. Of the 87 acetylation sites, 25 were quantifiable and 19 were quantified with ratio of >1.3. Notably, no downregulated lysine acetylation (Kac) sites were quantified in the present study and the 62 unquantified Kac sites were only identified in the FK228-treated cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these quantifiable proteins were primarily involved in multiple biological functions and metabolic pathways as well as in protein complexes. The results of the present study revealed the extensive lysine acetylome and proteome in EC109 cells and expanded upon the current understanding of the anticancer mechanism of FK228 in EC109 cells."
424637300013,ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA,"Evaluation of nickel-molybdenum-oxides as cathodes for hydrogen evolution by water electrolysis in acidic, alkaline, and neutral media","Hydrogen produced by electrolysis employing wind/hydro/solar electricity has been identified as a promising renewable and environmentally-friendly energy carrier. The current paper is a study on the investigation of electrocatalytic properties of Ni-Mo-oxides in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by water electrolysis in the acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes. The Ni-Mo-oxides of several compositions were formed on a titanium substrate employing a thermal-decomposition method. The morphology of the obtained coatings was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, and their crystallinity by X-ray diffraction. Linear Tafel polarization and chronoamperometry were used to determine the extrinsic and intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the coatings (cathodes) in the HER. The most extrinsically active coating was found to be Ni0.6Mo0.8-oxide (in all three electrolytes), while this coating showed the highest intrinsic activity only in the neutral electrolyte. In the acidic and alkaline electrolyte, the Ni0.8Mo0.2-oxide coating was found to be most intrinsically active. In the alkaline electrolyte, the Ni0.8Mo0.2-oxide cathode had twice the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the current state-of-the- art, pure nickel. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
454189800004,ONCOLOGY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT,Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio as a Prognostic Factor in European Patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors,"Background: A high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been associated with adverse outcomes in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, information on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant advanced NSCLC is scarce, and most of the studies published have been conducted in Asian populations. We aimed to assess the influence of pretreatment NLR on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in Western European patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Methods: A retrospective evaluation of 41 patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs between June 2010 and May 2016 was carried out. The association between several prognostic factors including pretreatment NLR and survival was analyzed. Results: Median PFS and OS were 10.58 and 20.84 months, respectively. OS for patients with a high NLR was 7.4 months, compared to 24.6 months for patients with a low NLR (p = 0.0122). In multivariate analysis, poor performance status (ECOG PS = 2) and presence of >= 3 metastatic locations were identified as significant independent prognostic factors for worse PFS. For OS, unfavorable prognostic factors were a high NLR and central nervous system metastasis at diagnosis. Conclusion: Pretreatment NLR is an independent prognostic factor for OS in Western European patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs. (c) 2018 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg"
428324700009,HEALTH ECONOMICS,The impact of a mosquito net voucher subsidy programme on incremental ownership: The case of the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme,"The subsidisation of mosquito nets has been widely used to increase ownership in countries where malaria represents a public health problem. However, an important question that has not been addressed empirically is how far net subsidy programmes increase ownership above the level that would have prevailed in the absence of the subsidy (i.e., incremental ownership). This study addresses that gap by investigating the impact of a large-scale mosquito net voucher subsidy--the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme (TNVS)--on short-term demand for unsubsidised commercial nets, estimating a household demand model with nationally representative household survey data. The results suggest that, despite the TNVS using a categorical targeting approach that did not discriminate by wealth, it still led to a large increase in incremental ownership of mosquito nets, with limited evidence of displacement of unsubsidised sales. Although no evidence is found of an additional TNVS voucher decreasing the number of unsubsidised sales in the same period, results indicate that an additional TNVS voucher reduced the probability of purchasing any unsubsidised net in the same period by 14%. The findings also highlight the critical role played by social learning or campaign messaging in increasing mosquito net ownership."
442063100007,JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY,Surgical strategy and outcomes for the delayed diagnosis of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum,"Background: In the present study, we summarize the experiences and evaluate clinical outcomes for the delayed diagnosis of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) patients when undergoing an initial visit and diagnosis in our heart center. Methods: Fifty-eight cases of delayed diagnosis of PAIVS in patients aged more than 6 months between January 2006 and June 2016 were reviewed in our hospital. The median age at initial diagnosis was 12.2 months (range, 6.1-79.6 months). Forty-five cases eventually reached definitive repair. Survival, risk factors for death, and clinical status after definitive repair were assessed. Results: Among patients who completed definitive repair, the Fontan procedure was performed in a large proportion of older PAIVS children (42.2%, 19/45), while only a few patients received biventricular repair (22.2%, 10/45). The medium-term (10-year) survival rates of biventricular repair, 1.5-ventricular repair, and univentricular palliation were 100.0%, 93.3%, and 81.2%, respectively. At the latest follow-up, most patients had a good clinical status after definitive repairs, with a low re-operation rate. Conclusions: A large proportion of the delayed diagnosis of PAIVS patients had to receive univentricular palliation because of limited potential for right ventricular growth. However, optimal definitive repairs could also have been achieved in these patients with a low mortality rate. (C) 2018 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

429729200006,ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL,Properties of Merger Shocks in Merging Galaxy Clusters,"X-ray shocks and radio relics detected in the cluster outskirts are commonly interpreted as shocks induced by mergers of subclumps. We study the properties of merger shocks in merging galaxy clusters, using a set of cosmological simulations for the large-scale structure formation of the universe. As a representative case, we focus on the simulated clusters that undergo almost head-on collisions with mass ratio similar to 2. Due to the turbulent nature of the intracluster medium, shock surfaces are not smooth, but composed of shocks with different Mach numbers. As the merger shocks expand outward from the core to the outskirts, the average Mach number, < M-s >, increases in time. We suggest that the shocks propagating along the merger axis could be manifested as X-ray shocks and/or radio relics. The kinetic energy through the shocks, F-phi, peaks at similar to 1 Gyr after their initial launching, or at similar to 1-2 Mpc from the core. Because of the Mach number dependent model adopted here for the cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration efficiency, their CR-energy-weighted Mach number is higher with < M-s >(CR) similar to 3-4, compared to the kinetic-energy-weighted Mach number, < M-s >(phi) similar to 2-3. Most energetic shocks are to be found ahead of the lighter dark matter (DM) clump, while the heavier DM clump is located on the opposite side of clusters. Although our study is limited to the merger case considered, the results such as the means and variations of shock properties and their time evolution could be compared with the observed characteristics of merger shocks, constraining interpretations of relevant observations."
432942700111,WORLD NEUROSURGERY,Case of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage from Ruptured Oncotic Fusiform Aneurysms from Choriocarcinoma Metastasis Treated with Aneurysmectomy and Vessel Reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Oncotic aneurysm is a rare condition with a high mortality rate. Because no consensus has been reached regarding therapeutic strategy for ruptured oncotic aneurysm, treatment remains challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old woman developed sudden onset of severe headache. Computed tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral angiography revealed 2 fusiform aneurysms in the distal portion of the left middle cerebral artery. Aneurysmectomy with vessel reconstruction using a superficial temporal artery graft was performed to maintain blood flow to the distal middle cerebral artery. Pathologic examination of the aneurysm and wall of the resected recipient middle cerebral artery showed infiltrating trophoblasts. Immunostaining for human chorionic gonadotropin was positive in the aneurysm specimen. On the basis of an elevated concentration of serum human chorionic gonadotropin, choriocarcinoma with ruptured intracranial oncotic aneurysms was diagnosed. After further systemic examination for carcinoma, chemotherapy was initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmectomy, resection of the parent artery with irregular walls and reconstruction to the distal recipient artery with normal intima should be considered to secure patency of the anastomosis and prevent the recurrence of oncotic aneurysm. Subsequent chemotherapy is essential to prevent carcinomatous meningitis and disease progression."
438100300003,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION,A cultural assets model for school effectiveness,"This paper offers a cultural assets model for supporting school effectiveness that moves beyond the deficit and difference approaches of the twentieth century. The model incorporates the capacity to identify contemporary cultural assets, and support cultural continuity, cultural diversity and cultural resilience during change. Undertaking concept-centric analysis, the reconceptualised understanding of contemporary cultural assets informs the construction of schools as cultural hubs, and reveals seven benefits that enhance asset-based approaches to school effectiveness. The model incorporates multigenerational flows of influence, community cultural activities, a communication conduit, and glocalised interactions. An empirical analysis of evidence advances the model's sociocultural view of effective schools; provides opportunities to extend research beyond minority studies; and establishes the importance of cultural assets in secure base leadership for developing schools as dynamic organisations."

452346000045,NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,Prox1 mRNA expression in the medial cortex of the turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans),"The medial cortex of the cerebrum in reptiles is thought to be homologous to the mammalian dentate gyrus, based on cytoarchitectures, fiber connections, and neurochemical profiles. To support this hypothesis, we examined the mRNA expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), a glutamatergic gene marker, and Prox1, a selective gene marker for granule cells of the dentate gyrus, in the turtle medial cortex (zone 2). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of both mRNAs in the turtle cerebrum. In situ hybridization of zone 2, which is a layer of densely packed neurons in Nissl stains, intensely expressed vGluT1 and Prox1. In zone 3, which is a loosely packed layer, vGluT1 was intensely expressed, whereas Prox signals gradated from strong to negative toward zone 4. These findings demonstrate that zone 2 contains glutamatergic neurons and expresses Prox1 mRNA and suggest that zone 2 in the turtle cerebrum is homologous to the mammalian dentate gyrus."
437425100004,JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS,Midline (central) fluid percussion model of traumatic brain injury in pediatric and adolescent rats,"OBJECTIVE Experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) models hold significant validity to the human condition, with each model replicating a subset of clinical features and symptoms. TBI is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children and teenagers; thus, it is critical to develop preclinical models of these ages to test emerging treatments. Midline fluid percussion injury (FPI) might best represent mild and diffuse clinical brain injury because of the acute behavioral deficits, the late onset of behavioral morbidities, and the absence of gross histopathology. In this study, the authors sought to adapt a midline FPI to postnatal day (PND) 17 and 35 rats. The authors hypothesized that scaling the craniectomy size based on skull dimensions would result in a reproducible injury comparable to the standard midline FPI in adult rats. METHODS PND17 and PND35 rat skulls were measured, and trephines were scaled based on skull size. Custom trephines were made. Rats arrived on PND10 and were randomly assigned to one of 3 cohorts: PND17, PND35, and 2 months old. Rats were subjected to midline FPI, and the acute injury was characterized. The right reflex was recorded, injury-induced apnea was measured, injury-induced seizure was noted, and the brains were immediately examined for hematoma. RESULTS The authors' hypothesis was supported; scaling the trephines based on skull size led to a reproducible injury in the PND17 and PND35 rats that was comparable to the injury in a standard 2-month-old adult rat. The midline FPI suppressed the righting reflex in both the PND17 and PND35 rats. The injury induced apnea in PND17 rats that lasted significantly longer than that in PND35 and 2-month-old rats. The injury also induced seizures in 73% of PND17 rats compared with 9% of PND35 rats and 0% of 2-month-old rats. There was also a significant relationship between the righting reflex time and presence of seizure. Both PND17 and PND35 rats had visible hematomas with an intact dura, indicative of diffuse injury comparable to the injury observed in 2-month-old rats. CONCLUSIONS With these procedures, it becomes possible to generate brain-injured juvenile rats (pediatric [PND17] and adolescent [PND35]) for studies of injury induced pathophysiology and behavioral deficits, for which rational therapeutic interventions can be implemented."
429816400014,DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES,Determinants and Outcomes of Hospice Utilization Among Patients with Advance-Staged Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Veteran Affairs Population,"Background Hospice provides integrative palliative care for advance-staged hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, but hospice utilization in HCC patients in the USA is not clearly understood. Aims We examined hospice use and subsequent clinical course in advance-staged HCC patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective study on a national, Veterans Affairs cohort with stage C or D HCC. We evaluated demographics, clinical factors, treatment, and clinical course in relation to hospice use. Results We identified 814 patients with advanced HCC, of whom 597 (73.3%) used hospice. Oncologist management consistently predicted hospice use, irrespective of HCC treatment [no treatment: OR 2.25 (1.18-4.3), treatment: OR 1.80 (1.10-2.95)]. Among patients who received HCC treatment, hospice users were less likely to have insurance beyond VA benefits (47.2 vs. 60.0%, p = 0.01). Among patients without HCC treatment, hospice users were older (62.2 [17.2] vs. 60.2 [14.0] years, p = 0.05), white (62.1 vs. 52.9%, p = 0.01), resided in the Southern USA (39.5 vs. 31.8%, p = 0.05), and had a performance score >= 3 (41.9 vs. 31.8%, p = 0.01). The median time from hospice entry to death or end of study was 1.05 [2.96] months for stage C and 0.53 [1.18] months for stage D patients. Conclusions 26.7% advance-staged HCC patients never entered hospice, representing potential missed opportunities for improving end-of-life care. Age, race, location, performance, insurance, and managing specialty can predict hospice use. Differences in managing specialty and short-term hospice use suggest that interventions to optimize early palliative care are necessary."
418796000005,ANALES DE PSICOLOGIA,Stepped psychological intervention with common mental disorders in Primary Care,"A model of psychological intervention for common mental disorders in Primary Care is analized. Two clinical psychologists and four resident psychologists interviewed 566 users to treat mild to moderate anxiety / depression disorders, bereavement or nonorganic insomnia disorders. Standardized assessment leads to a stepped intervention: indication of no treatment, brief group or individual intervention in Primary Care Center (PCC) or referral to Mental Health. Socio-demographic and clinical variables describe the sample and allow comparison betwen groups. Of the 566 interviewees, the mean age was 37 years, 70% were women, 50% with psychopharmacological treatment and 10% on sick leave. The steps of intervention were: 19% were intervention indication of no treatment, 71% PCC intervention and 10% were referred to Mental Health. Adaptive, emotional and generalized anxiety disorders were predominant, with significant differences between centers depending on the location and clinical psychologist integration mode in PCC. Integrating the clinical psychologist in PCC improve access to psychological interventions and reduces mild to moderate mental disorders medication. Assessment prevents unnecessary treatment onset and increases the likelihood of appropriate treatment indications, which is cost-effective."
431994700015,NEUROCRITICAL CARE,Levetiracetam Pharmacokinetics in a Critically Ill Anephric Patient on Intermittent Hemodialysis,"Background In patients requiring hemodialysis, the extracorporeal circuit is expected to remove the majority of serum levetiracetam. The preferred levetiracetam dosing regimen in critically ill patients exhibiting complex pharmacokinetic profiles undergoing hemodialysis is unknown. The objective of this case is to describe levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in a critically ill anephric patient receiving intermittent hemodialysis. Methods This is a case report of a single patient. Results A 43-year-old anephric female was admitted to the intensive care unit for concerns of new onset seizure activity. She was loaded with 2000 mg levetiracetam followed by a 750 mg daily maintenance dose. The levetiracetam volume of distribution was 0.48 L/kg, and the interdialytic elimination half-life was 31 h. Hemodialysis removed nearly 85% of serum levetiracetam, and the patient exhibited slightly higher than expected non-renal elimination. Pharmacokinetic simulations identified 500 mg daily with 750 mg post-dialysis supplements as the regimen most likely to reduce variability in serum levetiracetam concentrations and achieve levels in the therapeutic range. Conclusion Substantial elimination of levetiracetam by hemodialysis occurred in this case, and non-renal clearance was slightly higher than in previous reports. Insufficient intradialytic or post-dialysis levetiracetam concentrations may place patients at risk of breakthrough seizures. This case indicates that dialysis patients on levetiracetam may require higher post-dialysis supplemental doses than currently recommended and tailored therapy supported by therapeutic drug monitoring."
450855400002,JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,Middle East and Southwest Asia Daily Precipitation Characteristics Associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation during Boreal Winter,"The spatial and temporal evolution of Middle East and southwest Asia (MESW) precipitation characteristics and the associated atmospheric circulation during times in which tropical eastern Indian Ocean precipitation is either enhanced or reduced associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is assessed. Using multiple estimates of both the observed precipitation and the MJO during 1981-2016, the evolution of MESW precipitation characteristics throughout November-April is examined in terms of monthly precipitation accumulation on precipitation days, the number of precipitation days, and the number of extreme precipitation days. MJO phases 2-4, during which eastern Indian Ocean precipitation is enhanced, and MJO phases 6-8, during which eastern Indian Ocean precipitation is reduced, are related, with significant decreases and increases in the number of precipitation days across MESW, respectively. The patterns of precipitationday changes between MJO phases undergo noteworthy spatial and temporal evolutions across the boreal cold season that are influenced by the interaction between Rossby wave forcing by the MJO and seasonal changes in both the upper-level jet and moisture over the region. During December-January, the changes in precipitation days are found primarily over northern MESW, while during February-March, the changes in precipitation days are found primarily over southern MESW. Although the results identify an important sensitivity in the number of precipitation days over the MESW related to the MJO, the same sensitivity is not apparent in terms of the number of extreme precipitation days and, in particular, the amount of precipitation on a precipitation day."

The results match the conclusions from an earlier experimental study and enable a further interpretation of the previously observed complex reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the interplay between neutral and cationic reaction pathways in titanium(iii)-catalysed reactions is investigated for the first time. The results show that hydrochloride additives and reaction byproducts play an important role in the respective equilibria. A full reaction profile is assembled and the computed activation barrier is found to be in reasonable agreement with the experiment. The conclusions are of fundamental importance to the field of low-valent titanium catalysis and the understanding of related catalytic radical-radical coupling reactions."
429385700039,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,Satellite-Based Estimates of Daily NO2 Exposure in China Using Hybrid Random Forest and Spatiotemporal Kriging Model,"A novel model named random-forest-spatiotemporal-kriging (RF-STK) was developed to estimate the daily ambient NO2 concentrations across China during 2013-2016 based on the satellite retrievals and geographic covariates. The RF-STK model showed good prediction performance, with cross-validation R-2 = 0.62 (RMSE = 13.3 g/m(3)) for daily and R-2 = 0.73 (RMSE = 6.5 g/m(3)) for spatial predictions. The nationwide population-weighted multiyear average of NO2 was predicted to be 30.9 +/- 11.7 mu g/m(3) (mean +/- standard deviation), with a slowly but significantly decreasing trend at a rate of -0.88 +/- 0.38 mu g/m(3)/year. Among the main economic zones of China, the Pearl River Delta showed the fastest decreasing rate of -1.37 mu g/m(3)/year, while the Beijing-Tianjin Metro did not show a temporal trend (P = 0.32). The population-weighted NO2 was predicted to be the highest in North China (40.3 +/- 10.3 mu g/m(3)) and lowest in Southwest China (24.9 +/- 9.4 mu g/m(3)). Approximately 25% of the population lived in nonattainment areas with annual-average NO2 > 40 g/m(3). A piecewise linear function with an abrupt point around 100 people/km(2) characterized the relationship between the population density and the NO2, indicating a threshold of aggravated NO2 pollution due to urbanization. Leveraging the ground-level NO2 observations, this study fills the gap of statistically modeling nationwide NO2 in China, and provides essential data for epidemiological research and air quality management."

This study evaluated the clinical and angiographic profile of young adults (< 35 years) with CAD. Methods: A 10-year (2003-2012) retrospective chart review was performed on patients less than 35 years diagnosed with CAD at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, Durban. Results: Of the 100 patients who met the study criteria, the majority were male (90%), of Indian ethnicity (79%), and presented with acute coronary syndrome (93%). Smoking (82%), dyslipidaemia (79%) and dysglycaemia (75%) were the most prevalent risk factors. Almost half of the subjects (48%) met criteria for the metabolic syndrome. Angiographic findings revealed multi-vessel (42%), single-vessel (36%) and non-occlusive disease (20%); only two subjects had normal epicardial vessels. Disease severity was influenced by dyslipidaemia (p = 0.002) and positive family history (p = 0.002). Non-coronary aetiologies were identified in 19% of subjects. Conclusions: Atherosclerotic disease associated with risk-factor clustering was highly prevalent in young adults with CAD."
433521500007,BIOCHEMICAL GENETICS,Development of SCoT-Based SCAR Marker for Rapid Authentication of Taxus Media,"Taxus media is an important species in the family Taxaceae with high medicinal and commercial value. Overexploitation and illegal trade have led T. media to a severe threat of extinction. In addition, T. media and other Taxus species have similar morphological traits and are easily misidentified, particularly during the seedling stage. The purpose of this study is to develop a species-specific marker for T. media. Through a screening of 36 start codon targeted (SCoT) polymorphism primers, among 15 individuals of 4 Taxus species (T. media, T. chinensis, T. cuspidate and T. fuana), a clear species-specific DNA fragment (amplified by primer SCoT3) for T. media was identified. After isolation and sequencing, a DNA sequence with 530 bp was obtained. Based on this DNA fragment, a primer pair for the sequence-characterized amplified region marker was designed and named MHSF/MHSR. PCR analysis with primer pair MHSF/MHSR revealed a clear amplified band for all individuals of T. media but not for T. chinensis, T. cuspidate and T. fuana. Therefore, this marker can be used as a quick, efficient and reliable tool to identify T. media among other related Taxus species. The results of this study will lay an important foundation for the protection and management of T. media as a natural resource."
442395600003,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,Anhedonia and Smoking Cessation Among Spanish-Speaking Mexican-Americans,"Objective: Smoking cessation is associated with improved health and reduced risk of disease. Understanding specific factors that are associated with smoking cessation is important both for identifying those who may have the greatest difficulty quitting smoking and tailoring smoking cessation interventions accordingly. Low positive affect/anhedonia. a key transdiagnostic symptom of several psychiatric disorders, is associated with lower levels of smoking cessation in the general population, but to date, few studies have examined factors influencing smoking cessation among Spanish-speaking Mexican-American smokers. Methods: The current study examined whether low positive affect/anhedonia was inversely related to cessation status across 3 time points among Spanish-speaking Mexican-American smokers (N = 199) who were making a smoking quit attempt. Results: Using multilevel modeling, the between-person low positive affect/anhedonia score was found to be inversely associated with smoking at quit day, 3 and 26 weeks after quit while controlling for relevant covariates (i.e., age, gender, education, income, relationship status. heaviness of smoking index) but not when controlling for other symptoms of depression. Conclusions: Contrary to prior research, the results of this study did not confirm the unique predictive role of low positive affect/anhedonia among Mexican Americans. suggesting that risk factors for this group may be different from other populations and cessation approaches may also need to differ."
435822800013,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING,A study of parent-adolescent interaction: The impact of family communication patterns on adolescents' influence strategies and parents' response strategies,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of family communication patterns (FCP) on adolescents' choice of influence strategies and parents' choice of response strategies in situations of parent-child purchase decision disagreement. Design/methodology/approach This study uses family triadic (mother-father-child) survey data collected from 294 Korean families. The study develops classifications of adolescent influence strategies and parental response strategies in the initial stage and subsequently investigates the impact of FCP on the adolescent child's use of influence strategies and each parent's use of response strategies. The final stage of the study involved an exploratory investigation aimed at discovering the adolescent influence strategies and parental response strategies that are likely used in conjunction. Findings Results show an overall significant impact of FCP on both adolescents' use of influence strategies and parents' use of response strategies. They further reveal that Korean mothers tended to encounter their children's persistent influence attempts with unyielding, strict response strategies. The types of response strategies used by Korean fathers were not linked to particular types of influence strategies used by their children but linked to their level of education attained and household income. Practical implications Findings of this study may help marketers formulate an appropriate marketing communication strategy that can be effective in resolving parent-child purchase disagreement. Originality/value With its focus on the adolescent influence strategies, parental response strategies, and FCP as a factor influencing the strategy choice by adolescents and parents, this study provides new insights into the parent-child interaction taking place in situations of parent-child disagreement about a purchase decision."
433993500001,BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE,Effectiveness of a standardized electronic admission order set for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Background: Variation in hospital management of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) may prolong length of stay, increasing the risk of hospital-acquired complications and worsening quality of life. We sought to determine whether an evidence-based computerized AECOPD admission order set could improve quality and reduce length of stay. Methods: The order set was designed by a provincial COPD working group and implemented voluntarily among three physician groups in a Canadian tertiary-care teaching hospital. The primary outcome was length of stay for patients admitted during order set implementation period, compared to the previous 12 months. Secondary outcomes included length of stay of patients admitted with and without order set after implementation, all-cause readmissions, and emergency department visits. Results: There were 556 admissions prior to and 857 admissions after order set implementation, for which the order set was used in 47%. There was no difference in overall length of stay after implementation (median 6.37 days (95% confidence interval 5.94, 6.81) pre-implementation vs. 6.02 days (95% confidence interval 5.59, 6.46) post-implementation, p = 026). In the post-implementation period, order set use was associated with a 1.15-day reduction in length of stay (95% confidence interval -0.5, -1.81, p = 0.001) compared to patients admitted without the order set There was no difference in readmissions. Conclusions: Use of a computerized guidelines-based admission order set for COPD exacerbations reduced hospital length of stay without increasing readmissions. Interventions to increase order set use could lead to greater improvements in length of stay and quality of care."
452108200005,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE,A stochastic model that explains axonal organelle pileups induced by a reduction of molecular motors,"Nerve cells are critically dependent on the transport of intracellular cargoes, which are moved by motor proteins along microtubule tracks. Impairments in this movement are thought to explain the focal accumulations of axonal cargoes and axonal swellings observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases, these diseases are caused by mutations that impair motor protein function, and genetic depletion of functional molecular motors has been shown to lead to cargo accumulations in axons. The evolution of these accumulations has been compared to the formation of traffic jams on a highway, but this idea remains largely untested. In this paper, we investigated the underlying mechanism of local axonal cargo accumulation induced by a global reduction of functional molecular motors in axons. We hypothesized that (i) a reduction in motor number leads to a reduction in the number of active motors on each cargo which in turn leads to less persistent movement, more frequent stops and thus shorter runs; (ii) as cargoes stop more frequently, they impede the passage of other cargoes, leading to local ` traffic jams'; and (iii) collisions between moving and stopping cargoes can push stopping cargoes further away from their microtubule tracks, preventing them from reattaching and leading to the evolution of local cargo accumulations. We used a lattice-based stochastic model to test whether this mechanism can lead to the cargo accumulation patterns observed in experiments. Simulation results of the model support the hypothesis and identify key questions that must be tested experimentally."
430900000004,MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS,"Thermodynamics, kinetics and selectivity of H-2 and D-2 on zeolite 5A below 77K","Thermodynamics, kinetics and selectivity of H-2 and D-2 on zeolite 5A have been investigated by isotherm adsorption/desorption and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) at temperatures below 77 K. The experimental adsorption isotherms show an increasing amount of gas adsorbed with decreasing temperature from 77 K to 30 K, and D-2/H-2 adsorption ratio is slightly larger than 1. In addition, the enthalpy of D-2 (Delta H) adsorption obtained from adsorption isotherms is for different uptakes always larger than for H-2 indicating a stronger D-2 adsorption. The kinetics of H-2 adsorption/desorption is faster than of D-2 at different temperatures (30-50 K), pressures (10-400 mbar) and gas composition due to the faster H-2 self-diffusion in zeolite 5A at low temperature. Furthermore, D-2/H-2 selectivity increases gradually and reaches a constant value with increasing loading time and pressure, and it is 8.83, 6.42, 4.98, 3.96 and 4.04 at 30, 35, 40, 50 and 60 K at 50 mbar, respectively. The D-2/H-2 separation in zeolite 5A is controlled by the thermodynamic equilibrium of adsorption under the experimental conditions applied here. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the hydrogen isotope selectivity of zeolite 5A at temperatures below 77 K."
433088800009,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY,Collision activity during training increases total energy expenditure measured via doubly labelled water,"Collision sports are characterised by frequent high-intensity collisions that induce substantial muscle damage, potentially increasing the energetic cost of recovery. Therefore, this study investigated the energetic cost of collision-based activity for the first time across any sport. Using a randomised crossover design, six professional young male rugby league players completed two different 5-day pre-season training microcycles. Players completed either a collision (COLL; 20 competitive one-on-one collisions) or non-collision (nCOLL; matched for kinematic demands, excluding collisions) training session on the first day of each microcycle, exactly 7 days apart. All remaining training sessions were matched and did not involve any collision-based activity. Total energy expenditure was measured using doubly labelled water, the literature gold standard. Collisions resulted in a very likely higher (4.96 +/- 0.97 MJ; ES = 0.30 +/- 0.07; p = 0.0021) total energy expenditure across the 5-day COLL training microcycle (95.07 +/- 16.66 MJ) compared with the nCOLL training microcycle (90.34 +/- 16.97 MJ). The COLL training session also resulted in a very likely higher (200 +/- 102 AU; ES = 1.43 +/- 0.74; p = 0.007) session rating of perceived exertion and a very likely greater (- 14.6 +/- 3.3%; ES = - 1.60 +/- 0.51; p = 0.002) decrease in wellbeing 24 h later. A single collision training session considerably increased total energy expenditure. This may explain the large energy expenditures of collision-sport athletes, which appear to exceed kinematic training and match demands. These findings suggest fuelling professional collision-sport athletes appropriately for the ""muscle damage caused"" alongside the kinematic ""work required""."
434032600022,ADVANCED MATERIALS,Phase Transition Control for High Performance Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite Solar Cells,"Ruddlesden-Popper reduced-dimensional hybrid perovskite (RDP) semiconductors have attracted significant attention recently due to their promising stability and excellent optoelectronic properties. Here, the RDP crystallization mechanism in real time from liquid precursors to the solid film is investigated, and how the phase transition kinetics influences phase purity, quantum well orientation, and photovoltaic performance is revealed. An important template-induced nucleation and growth of the desired (BA)(2)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 phase, which is achieved only via direct crystallization without formation of intermediate phases, is observed. As such, the thermodynamically preferred perpendicular crystal orientation and high phase purity are obtained. At low temperature, the formation of intermediate phases, including PbI2 crystals and solvate complexes, slows down intercalation of ions and increases nucleation barrier, leading to formation of multiple RDP phases and orientation randomness. These insights enable to obtain high quality (BA)(2)(MA)(3)Pb4I13 films with preferentially perpendicular quantum well orientation, high phase purity, smooth film surface, and improved optoelectronic properties. The resulting devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 12.17%. This work should help guide the perovskite community to better control Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite structure and further improve optoelectronic and solar cell devices."
437815500043,TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO,Pre-validation of an in vitro skin irritation test for medical devices using the reconstructed human tissue model EpiDerm (TM),"Assessment of dermal irritation is an essential component of the safety evaluation of medical devices. Reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) models have replaced rabbit skin irritation testing for neat chemicals and their mixtures (OECD Test Guideline 439). However, this guideline cannot be directly applied to the area of medical devices (MD) since their non-toxicity assessment is largely based on the testing of MD extracts that may have very low irritation potential. Therefore, the RhE-methods previously validated with neat chemicals needed to be modified to reflect the needs for detection of low levels of potential irritants. A protocol employing RhE EpiDerm was optimized in 2013 using known irritants and spiked polymers (Casas et al., 2013, TIV). In 2014 and 2015 MatTek In Vitro Life Science Laboratories (IVLSL) and RIVM assessed the transferability of the assay. After the successful transfer and standardization of the protocol, 17 laboratories were trained in the use of the protocol in the preparation for the validation. Laboratories produced data with 98% agreement of predictions for the selected references and controls. We conclude that a modified RhE skin irritation test has the potential to address the skin irritation potential of the medical devices. Standardization and focus on the technical issues is essential for accurate prediction."
430317500010,HEPATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL,High prevalence of HCV (GT4)-related TSH abnormality among 13402 Egyptian patients treated with direct acting antiviral therapy,"Background HCV is associated with several extra hepatic diseases including thyroid dysfunction. This study aims at evaluating prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and its possible predictors in a large cohort of HCV GT4-infected patients, and the role of thyroid dysfunction as a predictor of response in the setting of direct acting antivirals (DAAs). Methods Patients registered on the web-based registry system to receive therapy for chronic HCV in Beheira governorate viral hepatitis specialized treatment center affiliated to the National committee for control of viral hepatitis (NCCVH), Ministry of health, Egypt in the period from January 2015 to October 2016. Their data were exported and analyzed for the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and its associated variables. Results Out of 13,402 patients, 2833 (21.1%) had elevated TSH level[4.5 mIU/l (hypothyroidism). Female gender (62.7%), older age, higher FIB4, AST, and BMI and lower albumin were significantly associated with elevated TSH level on univariate analysis, while liver stiffness measured by fibroscan was not significantly associated. On the other hand, 466 patients (3.5%) showed low TSH level <0.4 mIU/l (hyperthyroidism). Older age (median 52 years) and male gender (51.5%) were the only significantly associated variables. No association was found between SVR and baseline TSH level. Follow-up of 236 patients after SVR revealed improvement in TSH level in 80% of them. Conclusion Hypothyroidism is prevalent in patients with chronic HCV GT4, and is influenced by patient gender and age. Pretreatment TSH does not affect SVR after DAAs. Despite limited data SVR achievement after DAAs improves thyroid dysfunction."
451758200002,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,Assessment of Koelreuteria paniculata Seedling for Phytroremediation of Pyrene-Contaminated Soils,"Phytoremediation is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly technology using plants for the cleanup of both inorganic and organic contaminated sites. In this study, a pot culture experiment has been conducted for 180days in a greenhouse to examine the capability of Koelreuteria paniculata on pyrene (Pyr) dissipation in contaminated soil. Three treatments were employed and they were: (1) polluted soil with K. paniculata fine roots addition (T1), (2) polluted soil with planted seedlings (T2), and (3) polluted soil (C). Results showed Pyr concentration in soils was reduced by 21.4, 36.2, and 86.4% by natural losses, fine roots addition, and planted K. paniculata treatments, respectively, meaning plants substantially enhanced the dissipation of Pyr from soil. Cultivated K. paniculata seedlings significantly increased soil total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon, but not total phosphorus, when compared to the control. The removal efficiency of Pyr was lower in the adding of fine roots treatment than in the planted K. paniculata treatment. The principal component analysis indicated the promotional dissipation of Pyr in soil by planted K. paniculata was likely attributed to increased microbial quantity and activity, DOC, and TN content in the rhizosphere. Our results suggest that K. paniculata is a suitable plant species used in phytoremediation for Pyr-contaminated soils and the efficiency on the dissipation of Pyr is considerably enhanced using living plants than adding dead organic matters. The study provided a reference for the application of K. paniculata in the remediation of Pyr-contaminated soil."
436108900021,ORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS,"Computational study on the NHC-catalyzed synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted indoles: mechanism, key intermediate and the role of the catalyst","In this work, the possible reaction mechanisms and the role of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts in the umpolung reaction of imines to generate 2-substituted indole-3-acetic acid derivatives were investigated by density functional theory (DFT). Two different NHCs (named A-NHC and B-NHC) were studied as model catalysts. Calculations revealed that the whole reaction includes four steps: (1) the formation of a key aza-Breslow intermediate, (2) an intramolecular 1,4-addition, (3) a second 1,2-proton transfer, and (4) the desorption of the NHC to give 2-substituted indole-3-acetic acid derivatives. Furthermore, the nucleophilic attack of the NHC on the imine carbon or beta-carbon of the a, beta-unsaturated ester is the rate-limiting step that determines which intermediate is formed (the aza-Breslow or deoxy-Breslow intermediate). Analysis of the global reaction index indicates that NHCs play a vital role in the polarity reversal of an imine carbon atom or a beta-carbon from the a, beta-unsaturated ester. This strengthens the nucleophilicity of an imine carbon or a beta-carbon from the a, beta-unsaturated ester as a Lewis base. In addition, B-NHC has a slightly higher nucleophilicity value, which makes the reactivity of B-NHC slightly better than that of A-NHC. The theoretical results obtained not only rationalize the experimental observations well but also provide important insight into the mechanistic details of the reaction."

429000500010,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RHEUMATIC DISEASES,Role of psychosocial reserve capacity in anxiety and depression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,"AimTo examine the relationship between reserve capacity measures and anxiety/depression among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from Southern California (SoCal), United States and Manila, Philippines. MethodsA total of 235 participants with SLE completed self-reported scales to assess anxiety/depression and psychosocial reserve capacity measures (self-esteem, optimism, personal mastery/coping skills, social support), socioeconomic status (SES) data, and Mexican SLE Disease Activity Index. Statistical analyses included independent sample t-tests, Chi-square, and point-biserial and Pearson correlations. ResultsOverall, participants from Manila reported lower SES than SoCal participants. Over half of Manila and SoCal participants (69% and 59.1%, respectively) reported high anxiety scores. SoCal participants had higher depression scores than Filipinos (66%, 27%, respectively, P < 0.001) despite appearing to be more resilient by exhibiting higher scores for all reserve capacity measures (P < 0.001). Participants with low self-esteem scores from both groups had higher anxiety and depression scores. SoCal participants who reported lower optimism, lower personal mastery and lower social support were more anxious and depressed, while Filipinos low on these three variables reported less depressive symptoms. ConclusionReduced psychosocial reserve capacity in individuals leads to vulnerabilities that may ultimately result in greater disease burden and psychological distress. Low self-esteem, optimism, coping and social support were associated with depression and low self-esteem was associated with anxiety for both groups. Despite the Filipino cohort's lower reserve capacity and SES, Filipino patients exhibited less depression than their SoCal counterparts, suggesting that other factors may protect them from experiencing depression."

No study has looked at the direct association between the patency of individual crural arteries and the healing of TMA. TMA relies on a posterior skin flap which derives its blood supply from the posterior tibial (PT) artery. We investigated the association between PT patency and achievement of successful TMA. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing TMA for complications of peripheral arterial occlusive disease in a regional vascular tertiary referral centre over a 9 year period (2006-2015). TMA was considered successful by the absence of a higher-level amputation. Follow-up was for a minimum of 12 months. Results: 24 patients (21 male; mean age 64 years) were studied. TMA was successful in 16 (67%). On statistical analysis, successful TMA was not significantly associated with vessel patency in either superficial femoral artery (SFA), or any single or combination of named crural artery. Conclusion: TMA healing can be achieved in the absence of a patent posterior tibial artery. We support the role of TMA in selected patients, given its benefits compared to transtibial amputation."
441230400004,OPHTHALMOLOGE,Evaluation of corneal biomechanics in keratoconus using dynamic ultra-high-speed Scheimpflug measurements,"The in vivo analysis of corneal biomechanics in patients with keratoconus is especially of interest with respect to diagnosis, follow-up and monitoring of the disease. For a better understanding it is necessary to describe the potential of dynamic Scheimpflug measurements for the detection and interpretation of biomechanical changes in keratoconus. The current state of analyzing biomechanical changes in keratoconus with the Corvis ST (Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) is described. This technique represents a new approach for understanding corneal biomechanics. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the device can biomechanically quantify a rigidity increasing effect of therapeutic UV-crosslinking and whether early stages of keratoconus can be detected using dynamic Scheimpflug analysis. In patients with keratoconus, the in vivo analysis of corneal biomechanics using dynamic Scheimpflug measurements as a supplementary procedure can be of advantage with respect to disease management. By optimization of screening of subclinical keratoconus stages, this method widens the analytic spectrum regarding diagnosis and follow-up of the disease; however, further studies are required to evaluate whether visual outcome of affected patients can be improved by earlier diagnosis."
430853600013,MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS,Energy-Efficiency Maximization with Non-linear Fractional Programming for Intelligent Device-to-Device Communications,"With the exponential growth of wireless users and their traffic demands, it is greatly increasing for the demand of the scarce spectrum resources in the communication networks. In order to enhance the performance of the wireless networks such as end-to-end delay, energy efficiency and throughput, the device-to-device (D2D) communication has been attracted more attention because the two devices in close proximity can communicate directly without traversing the central base station. However, most of users are very sensitive to the battery. Therefore, we aim to maximize the energy efficiency of wireless communication system in the context of underlaying device-to-device communication in this paper, We focus on the formulated power control and resource allocation problem which is non-convex in the fractional form. We reduce it from the power allocation of all users to the joint power and subchannel allocation of D2D users. Then, we tackle it by an iterative approximation algorithm leveraging to the properties of fractional programming. There are two studied cases for the subchannel allocation. One can be solved by the penalty function approach, and the other can be solved by the dual decomposition as well as sub-gradient method. Accordingly, we propose a dual-based algorithm in general. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the conventional algorithm in terms of the energy efficiency."
441524300018,ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS,Numerical DEM simulation of AE in plate fracture and analogy with the frequency of seismic events in SCRs,"The present paper examines, by Monte Carlo simulation employing the Discrete Element Method (DEM), the occurrence of micro-fractures and the evolution of damage, as cracks coalesce in large fractures, in a plate subjected to increasing stress. Numerical simulations results which in previous studies predicted successfully acoustic emission (AE) in laboratory samples, are compatible with the conclusions of the assessment of instrumental data in a Stable Continental Regions (SCR). The locations of AE sources, correlated with the growth of a diagonal fracture in the plate, are numerically determined. Seismic activity, on the other hand, is higher along inter-plate boundaries, decreasing in intra-plate regions (SCR) where ifs prediction for engineering purposes presents great difficulties. The authors examined, in previous papers, instrumental seismic data for a 1200 km square region in the South American SCR, showing that the distribution of amplitudes is not exponential, as implicitly assumed in the Gutenberg-Richter law, and also that the largest events do not occur according to the distribution of small events. These contentions are also applicable to the numerical simulations described in the paper, illustrating similarity between the distributions of simulated AE events in the plate and seismic activity within a SCR."
425920000016,MATERIALS SCIENCE-MEDZIAGOTYRA,Development of Concrete Paving Blocks Prepared from Waste Materials without Portland Cement,"This experiment used three types of waste materials: calcium carbide residue, fly ash, and recycled concrete aggregate to develop concrete paving blocks. The blocks had calcium carbide residue and fly ash as a binder without ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and combined with 100 % of recycled concrete aggregate. The concrete paving blocks were 10 x 10 x 20 cm and were formed using a pressure of 6 or 8 MPa. The binder-to-aggregate ratio was held constant at 1: 3 by weight, while the water-to-binder ratios were 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40. The effects of the water-to-binder ratios and fineness of the binder on the compressive strength, flexural strength, abrasion resistance, and water absorption of the concrete paving blocks were determined and compared with those of TIS 827 and ASTM C1319 standards. The results revealed that by applying this procedure, we were able to produce an excellent concrete paving block without using OPC. The compressive strength of the concrete paving blocks made from these waste materials was 41.4 MPa at 28 days and increased to 45.3 MPa at 60 days. Therefore, these waste materials can be used as raw materials to manufacture concrete paving blocks without OPC that meet the requirements of 40 MPa and 35 MPa specified by the TIS 827 and ASTM C1319 standards, respectively."
452760400001,CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING,Cognitive status and use of analgesics and anxiolytics in residents of nursing homes in the Czech Republic,"Background: The treatment of pain and treatment of anxiety are two of the most complex issues in nursing homes worldwide, mainly because of the large numbers of people with cognitive impairment who reside in this environment. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the administration of analgesics and anxiolytics to people living in nursing homes, taking into account cognitive status. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, we used data from 404 residents who lived in nine randomly selected nursing homes in the Czech Republic and participated in the Czech-Austrian Long-Term Care Research Project called DEMDATA. Information about medication administration was obtained from medical records. Cognitive impairment was evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and pain was measured by the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia. To measure anxiety, we used the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale in residents with severe-to-moderate dementia and also the standardized questionnaire EuroQol in other residents. Results: In all, 68% (95% CI 62-74) of residents with pain did not receive any analgesic medication and 31% (95% CI 25-38) of residents were administered some analgesics and continued to report pain. The lowest reported occurrence of pain, as well as the lowest prevalence of analgesic administration, was in residents with moderate-to-severe dementia. We found that an alarming percentage of residents in the nursing homes were not treated sufficiently. Conclusion: This study indicates that treatment effects should be better monitored."

The PAN solutions were processed using the electrospinning process. Both untreated (neat) and G. mangostana-loaded PAN fibers were smooth in appearance, and the average diameter of samples was similar to 215 and similar to 245 nm, respectively. Morphologies, release characteristics, antimicrobial efficiencies against Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and anti-tuberculosis properties of the neat electrospun and 10-30% G. mangostana-loaded e-spun fiber mats were investigated. In vitro release studies of G. mangostana from e-spun PAN fiber mats were determined using the total immersion method in acetate buffer and phosphate buffer solutions containing Tween 80 and methanol. The cumulative released amount of G. mangostana from the samples proportionally increased with the increase of G. mangostana incorporated in the spinning solutions. This study demonstrated a convenient procedure with the potential to develop the antimicrobial and anti-tuberculosis properties of electrospun fibrous membranes containing G. mangostana, which are beneficial in filtration applications for respirators, face masks, and air-conditioning filters."
441250200002,COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS,"Euro adoption in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland: Laggards by default and laggards by choice","How can we explain the politics of euro adoption in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland? How did the euro crisis influence their positions regarding euro adoption? This article builds on the domestic politics literature and argues: (i) countries that had joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism-2 early had an easier time adopting the euro compared with those that did not; (ii) having a pro-euro government is a necessary but not sufficient condition to adopt the euro; (iii) the political ideology of the ruling elites is important; (iv) the existence of veto points in the domestic political system influences the entire process; (v) although the three countries have made central banks technically independent, the appointment process remains highly political and complex, which has led to conflicts between the central banks and the governments - negatively influencing euro adoption policies; and (vi) the issue does not have much salience in public opinion and thus does not usually feature high on the agenda of the political elites in the three countries. These three countries to date have not adopted the euro for various domestic political reasons. They have at different times been laggards by default or laggards by choice."

Body size-dependent bioaccumulation, tissue distribution, trophic magnification, and maternal transfer of methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparabens; 2-phenylphenol (PHP); BPA; triclosan; and triclocarban were investigated in freshwater fish of the Pearl River catchment, China. Most of the EDCs were detected in more than half of the biota samples, ranging from not detected to 6750ngg(-1) lipid weight, with median concentrations of 5 to 72ngg(-1) lipid weight. Livers generally contained the highest EDC levels (1609 +/- 1860ngg(-1) lipid wt, mean +/- standard deviation), followed in decreasing order by eggs (842 +/- 1317ngg(-1) lipid wt), belly fats (488 +/- 465ngg(-1) lipid wt), and dorsal muscles (240 +/- 239ngg(-1) lipid wt) of the wildlife. Body size-dependent bioaccumulation of the EDCs was observed in the freshwater fish, which varied according to species, tissue, and compound. The concentrations of triclosan, PHP, and BPA usually showed decreasing trends, whereas parabens mostly demonstrated increasing tendency with increasing fish weights, indicating effects of growth dilution and bioaccumulation, respectively. Potential biomagnification was shown by triclosan with trophic magnification factors of 3.0, 4.3, and 4.0 in liver, belly fat, and dorsal muscle, respectively. In addition, the potential of maternal transfer in the fish was primarily revealed for methyl- and propylparabens, PHP, triclosan, and BPA. Presence of the EDCs in the freshwater organisms of the Pearl River catchment warrants more attention considering the potential of trophic magnification and maternal transfer.

442173700005,TEKSTY DRUGIE,Metis: A-Systematic Knowledge,"Given the intellectual legacy of the Aristotelian distinction and hierarchization between practical and theoretical knowledge and the Cartesian dualism in the Western cognitive tradition, the non-discursive knowledge of the body has not raised much interest in modern science and philosophy. From the perspective of ethnography as research through practice, however, the role that the body's non-discursive knowledge plays in anthropological understanding takes on immense significance. Linking the practical experience of working on a potter's wheel with Lambros Malafouris's theory of material engagement, Klekot attempts to integrate non-discursive knowledge of the body into ethnographical cognition. Following Detienne Vernant, the non-discursive knowledge of the body is described with the Greek term meas. It is positioned in the context of discursive strategies from outside the mainstream of Western knowledge, which Foucault describes as'subjugated knowledges. From the perspective of a universalizing cognitive system such as the Western science, metis, which is situated and which resists abstraction, turns out to be a kind of knowledge that is asystematic."
423342400003,ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS,Protons Enhance Conductivities in Lithium Halide Hydroxide/Lithium Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes by Forming Rotating Hydroxy Groups,"Li-halide hydroxides (Li2OHX) and Li-oxyhalides (Li3OX) have emerged as new classes of low-cost, lightweight solid state electrolytes (SSE) showing promising Li-ion conductivities. The similarity in the lattice parameters between them, careless synthesis, and insufficient rigor in characterization often lead to erroneous interpretations of their compositions. Finally, moisture remaining in the synthesis or cell assembling environment and variability in the equivalent circuit models additionally contribute to significant errors in their properties. Thus, there remains a controversy about the real values of Li-ion conductivities in such SSEs. Here an ultra-fast synthesis and comprehensive material characterization is utilized to report on the ionic conductivities of contaminant-free Li2+xOH(1-x)Cl (x=0-0.7), and Li2OHBr not exceeding 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 110 degrees C. Using powerful combination of experimental and numerical approaches, it is demonstrated that the presence of H in these SSEs yields significantly higher Li+ -ionic conductivity. Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations show excellent agreement with experimental results and reveal an unexpected mechanism for faster Li+ transport. It involves rotation of a short OH-group in SSEs, which opens lower-energy pathways for the formation of Frenkel defects and highly-correlated Li+ jumps. These findings will reduce the existing confusions and show new avenues for tuning SSE compositions for further improved Li-ion conductivities."
454137600015,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Nucleotide-dependent DNA gripping and an end-clamp mechanism regulate the bacteriophage T4 viral packaging motor,"ATP-powered viral packaging motors are among the most powerful biomotors known. Motor subunits arranged in a ring repeatedly grip and translocate the DNA to package viral genomes into capsids. Here, we use single DNA manipulation and rapid solution exchange to quantify how nucleotide binding regulates interactions between the bacteriophage T4 motor and DNA substrate. With no nucleotides, there is virtually no gripping and rapid slipping occurs with only minimal friction resisting. In contrast, binding of an ATP analog engages nearly continuous gripping. Occasional slips occur due to dissociation of the analog from a gripping motor subunit, or force-induced rupture of grip, but multiple other analog-bound subunits exert high friction that limits slipping. ADP induces comparably infrequent gripping and variable friction. Independent of nucleotides, slipping arrests when the end of the DNA is about to exit the capsid. This end-clamp mechanism increases the efficiency of packaging by making it essentially irreversible."
444660600018,WASTE MANAGEMENT,Characteristics of geotextile clogging in MSW landfills co-disposed with MSWI bottom ash,"As a main byproduct of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI), bottom ash (BA) has become a big challenge in operating MSWI plants. The most common method for BA treatment is co-disposal with MSW in landfills, which may cause clogging in the leachate collection system (LCS). This research investigated the characteristics of geotextile clogging in landfills with BA co-disposal. The co-disposal of BA changed the characteristics of leachate, especially increasing the concentration of Ca2+. During the experiment, 0.14 g CaCO3 was precipitated in the MSW geotextile, while it increased to 0.52 g CaCO3 in the BA co-disposed geotextile. Based on mass balance of calcium and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, the formation of biofilm was the main contributor to the mass increment, accounting for about 82% and 57% mass increment in the MSW and BA co-disposed geotextile, respectively. Moreover, CO2 in landfill gas played an important role in the clogging process, including CaCO3 precipitation and biofilm formation. The results suggested that the co-disposal of BA with MSW can increase the risk of geotextile clogging in landfills. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
437824300007,COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS,ANALYSIS OF ITERATED GREEDY HEURISTIC FOR VERTEX CLIQUE COVERING,"The aim of the vertex clique covering problem (CCP) is to cover the vertices of a graph with as few cliques as possible. We analyse the iterated greedy (IG) algorithm for CCP, which was previously shown to provide strong empirical results for real-world networks. It is demonstrated how the techniques of analysis for randomised search heuristics can be applied to IG, and several practically relevant results are obtained. We show that for triangle-free graphs, IG solves CCP optimally in expected polynomial time. Secondly, we show that IG finds the optimum for CCP in a specific case of sparse random graphs in expected polynomial time with high probability. For Barabasi-Albert model of scale-free networks, which is a canonical model explaining the growth of social, biological or computer networks, we obtain that IG obtains an asymptotically optimal approximation in polynomial time in expectation. Last but not least, we propose a slightly modified variant of IG, which guarantees expected polynomial-time convergence to the optimum for graphs with non-overlapping triangles."
424994000016,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,High frequency compressional wave speed and attenuation measurements in water-saturated granular media with unimodal and bimodal grain size distributions,"Compressional wave speed and attenuation were measured for water-saturated granular media employing five kinds of glass beads having unimodal and bimodal grain size distributions. Glass beads with grain sizes ranging from 250 to 850 mu m were used for the acoustic measurements at a frequency range from 350 kHz to 1.1 MHz, which includes the transition range where scattering and non-scattering losses co-exist. The compressional wave speed and attenuation data are presented as a function of frequency and grain size distribution. The compressional wave speed and attenuation data show a variety of frequency dependencies for varying grain size distribution. The observed acoustic properties are investigated for the volume ratio of larger and smaller sized grains in the mixed bimodal media. Also, the measured results are compared with the empirical multiple scattering formula as a function of Rayleigh parameter kd (product of wavenumber in the water k and mean grain diameter of the glass beads d) using weighted mean grain size. The measured results are also discussed, focusing on the geophysical difference between unimodal and bimodal mixed grains. (C) 2018 Acoustical Society of America."

This is carried out with reconstructing a sparse coefficient matrix between test samples and training data. In the reconstruction process, an l(1)-norm regularization is employed to generate an element-wise sparsity coefficient matrix, and an LPP (Locality Preserving Projection) regularization is adopted to keep the local structures of data for achieving the efficiency. Further, with the learnt k value, k NN approach is applied to classification, regression and missing data imputation. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach with 20 real datasets, and show that our algorithm is much better than previous k NN algorithms in terms of data mining tasks, such as classification, regression and missing value imputation.

428019200008,VALUE IN HEALTH,Resource Use and Cost of Alzheimer's Disease in France: 18-Month Results from the GERAS Observational Study,"Background: There is little longitudinal data on resource use and costs associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in France. Objectives: To evaluate resource use and societal costs associated with AD in a French cohort of patients and their caregivers and the effect of patient cognitive decline on costs over an 18-month period. Methods: Community-dwelling patients with mild, moderate, or moderately severe/severe AD dementia (n = 419) were followed-up for 18 months. Total societal costs were estimated by applying 2010 unit costs to resource use, including outpatient visits, hospital days, institutionalization, and caregiver hours. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini Mental State Examination scores. Results: Mean cumulative total costs over the 18-month period were 24,140 for patients with mild AD dementia, 34,287 for those with moderate AD dementia, and 44,171 for those with moderately severe/severe AD dementia (P < 0.001; ANOVA comparison between severity groups). The biggest contributor to total societal costs was caregiver informal care ( >50% of total costs at all stages of AD dementia). Cognitive decline (>3-point decrease in Mini-Mental State Examination score or institutionalization) was associated with a 12.5% increase in total costs (P = 0.02). Significant differences were observed across severity groups for caregiver time (P < 0.001); mean monthly caregiver time increased at each time point over the 18 months in each severity group. Conclusions: Increasing severity of AD dementia in France is associated with increased use of resources as well as increased total societal and patient costs; informal care was the greatest cost contributor. Clinically meaningful cognitive decline is associated with significantly increased costs."
439543900037,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING,Applicability of the Porosity/Binder Index to Nonhomogeneous Mixtures of Fine-Grained Soil with Lignite Fly Ash,"Soil treatment using binders is an important method to enhance the strength, stiffness, and durability of soils. The porosity/binder concept has been developed to help with the mixture design for soil stabilization measures and has been verified for homogeneous mixtures. Unfortunately, in cases in which the base soil is fine-grained, it is typically not possible to obtain perfect mixture homogeneity on site. In such cases the binder typically forms a crust around soil clods. This study examines the applicability of the porosity/binder index to such non-homogeneous mixtures. For this purpose, the unconfined compressive strength of samples produced from homogeneous and non-homogeneous mixtures have been compared. In these mixtures, the addition rate, the dry density, and the water content were varied. It was found that the porosity/binder concept can be used to predict the strength of non-homogeneous field gradations of stabilized soils, provided that the clod size and water content of the laboratory samples resemble the clod size and water content of the material on site. The precision of predictability decreases with increasing variations of water content and mixture homogeneity."
444783400005,PHYSICAL REVIEW MATERIALS,Phonon scattering effects from point and extended defects on thermal conductivity studied via ion irradiation of crystals with self-impurities,"Fundamental theories predict that reductions in thermal conductivity from point and extended defects can arise due to phonon scattering with localized strain fields. To experimentally determine how these strain fields impact phonon scattering mechanisms, we employ ion irradiation as a controlled means of introducing strain and assorted defects into the lattice. In particular, we observe the reduction in thermal conductivity of intrinsic natural silicon after self-irradiation with two different silicon isotopes, Si-28(+) and Si-29(+). Irradiating with an isotope with a nearly identical atomic mass as the majority of the host lattice produces a damage profile lacking mass impurities and allows us to assess the role of phonon scattering with local strain fields on the thermal conductivity. Our results demonstrate that point defects will decrease the thermal conductivity more so than spatially extended defect structures assuming the same volumetric defect concentrations due to the larger strain per defect that arises in spatially separated point defects. With thermal conductivity models using density functional theory, we show that for a given defect concentration, the type of defect (i.e., point vs extended) plays a negligible role in reducing the thermal conductivity compared to the strain per defect in a given volume."
432935200010,FOREST SYSTEMS,Applying quantitative structure models to plot-based terrestrial laser data to assess dendrometric parameters in dense mixed forests,"Aim of study: To assess terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) accuracy in estimating biometrical forest parameters at plot-based level in order to replace manual survey for forest inventory purposes. Area of study: Monte Morello, Tuscany region, Italy. Materials and methods: In 14 plots (10 m radius) in dense Mediterranean mixed conifer forests, diameter at breast height (DBH) and height were measured in Summer 2016. Tree volume was computed using the second Italian National Forest Inventory (INFC II) equations. TLS data were acquired in the same plots and quantitative structure models (QSMs) were applied to TLS data to compute dendrometric parameters. Tree parameters measured in field survey, i.e. DBH, height, and computed volume, were compared to those resulting from TLS data processing. The effect of distance from the plot boundary in the accuracy of DBH, height and volume estimation from TLS data was tested. Main results: TLS-derived DBH showed a good correlation with the traditional forest inventory data (R-2=0.98, RRMSE=7.81%), while tree height was less correlated with the traditional forest inventory data (R-2=0.60, RRMSE=16.99%). Poor agreement was observed when comparing the volume from TLS data with volume estimated from the INFC II prediction equations. Research highlights: The study demonstrated that the application of QSM to plot-based terrestrial laser data generates errors in plots with high density of coniferous trees. A buffer zone of 5 m would help reduce the error of 35% and 42% respectively in height estimation for all trees and in volume estimation for broadleaved trees."
437088700022,JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,A leakage diagnosis testing model for gas wells with sustained casing pressure from offshore platform,"Sustained casing pressure (SCP) caused by tubing leakage is mostly considered as the dangerous situation in gas wells, which is more likely to pose a serious threat to well integrity and environmental protection. In order to assess the downhole risk in early time and further provide maintenance strategies to optimize well performance, it is necessary to diagnose the source of downhole leakage accurately. This paper presents a pressure-balance-based approach for capturing two types of dynamic annulus pressure behaviors in a gas well with SCP caused by tubing leakage at different well depths. The approach includes models that take into account the influence of temperature and pressure distributions of tubing and annulus fluid, which are used to determine tubing leakage points. In addition, such an approach involves the calculation of maximum annulus pressure at the wellhead in a gas well with SCP under four main cases, representing the effects of the leakage location, bottom hole pressure, annulus liquid level and gas production rate on wellhead pressure. Afterwards, an integrated diagnostic testing system has been developed to monitor the synthetic state of annulus fluid and liquid level parameters, ultimately identifying the source of SCP correctly. In contrast to previous works, leakage diagnostic testing can be performed from an offshore platform, and it meets the requirements of offshore field testing and works without a shut-in condition, which is capable of overcoming limitations of downhole detection. A case study focused on an offshore gas well with SCP is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, and also to demonstrate that leakage diagnosis contributes to the mechanism investigation of SCP, as well as the design improvement of gas wells integrity."
438365900005,INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE,0.005% Preservative-Free Latanoprost Induces Dry Eye-Like Ocular Surface Damage via Promotion of Inflammation in Mice,"PURPOSE. To investigate the side effects of preservative-free 0.005% latanoprost on the murine ocular surface. METHODS. We applied 0.005% latanoprost or vehicle in mice in two patterns for 14 to 28 days. Tear production was measured by phenol red cotton test, and corneal epithelial barrier function was assessed by Oregon-green-dextran (OGD) staining. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining was used to quantify conjunctival goblet cells (GCs). The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and -9, occludin-1 and zonula occludens (ZO)-1 in corneal epithelium was assessed by immunofluorescent staining and/or quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Inflammation in conjunctiva was assessed by activation of P38 and NF-kappa B, infiltration of CD4(+) T cells, and production inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, IL-17A, and IL-13. Apoptosis in ocular surface was assessed by TUNEL and immunofluorescent staining for activated caspase-3 and -8. Cell viability assay was performed in human corneal epithelial cells. RESULTS. Topical latanoprost treatment decreased tear production, induced conjunctival GC loss, disrupted the corneal epithelial barrier, and promoted cell apoptosis in the ocular surface. Topical latanoprost treatment increased the expression of MMP-3 and -9, and decreased the expression of ZO-1 and occludin-1 in the corneal epithelium. Topical application of latanoprost promoted activation of P38-NF-kappa B signaling and production of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in conjunctiva. Topical application of latanoprost increased CD4(+) T cells infiltration, with increased production of IFN-gamma and IL-17A and decreased production of IL-13 in conjunctiva. CONCLUSION. 0.005% latanoprost induced dry eye-like ocular surface damage via promotion of inflammation in mice."

A multiproperty fitting exercise was carried out in which we obtained a consistent set of Twu a function parameters for 2570 pure fluids based on the experimental data contained in the ThermoDataEngine (TDE) database developed at NIST. We have applied the consistency checks of Le Guennec et al. to the Twu a function of the Peng Robinson equation of state. The experimental data stored in the TDE passed through a critical evaluation, and we used only the data that were determined to be thermodynamically reliable. Over all the considered fluids, the mean average percentage error is approximately 7% for vapor pressure, 1% for latent heat of vaporization, and 1% for saturation specific heat."
438376800008,BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,"Cold acclimation increases cold tolerance independently of diapause programing in the bean bug, Riptortus pedestris","The bean bug (Riptortus pedestris) is a pest of soybeans and other legumes in Japan and other Asian countries. It enters a facultative adult diapause on exposure to short days. While photoperiod ism and diapause are well understood in R. pedestris, knowledge of cold tolerance is very limited, as is information on the effect of diapause on cold tolerance. We examined the effect of photoperiod, cold acclimation, and feeding status on cold tolerance in R. pedestris. We found that cold acclimation significantly increased survival at -10 degrees C in both long- and short-day adult R. pedestris. Since the difference in cold survival between long- and short-day cold-acclimated groups was only marginal, we conclude that entering diapause is not crucial for R. pedestris to successfully pass through cold acclimation and become cold tolerant. We observed similar effects in 5th instar nymphs, with both long- and short-day cold-acclimated groups surviving longer cold exposures compared with non-acclimated groups. Starvation, which was tested only in adult bugs, had only a negligible and negative impact on cold survival. Although cold tolerance significantly increased with cold acclimation in adult bugs, supercooling capacity unexpectedly decreased. Our results suggest that changes in supercooling capacity as well as in water content are unrelated to cold tolerance in R. pedestris. An analysis of metabolites revealed differences between the treatments, and while several metabolites markedly increased with cold acclimation, their concentrations were too low to have a significant effect on cold tolerance."
453266100001,IEEE ACCESS,ULES: Underwater Localization Evaluation Scheme Under Beacon Node Drift Scenes,"In underwater sensor localization scenes, beacon nodes (BNs) with known coordinates are deployed to localize unknown nodes (UNs). However, the BNs are likely to drift due to undercurrents, geological changes, and marine biological activities, which will lead to localization failure. This paper proposes underwater localization evaluation scheme (ULES) to improve localization accuracy under drift scenes. Reliability of BN is evaluated based on underwater drift, underwater environment, and underwater acoustic channel using an analytic hierarchy process and a grey correlation method. For each UN, four BNs in its communication range with high reliability are selected for underwater localization. This process can iterate for several times, and newly localized nodes act as temporary BNs in the next iteration. Simulations are performed for different localization schemes under different BN deployment schemes and scenarios. Results show that about a quarter more UNs obtain accurate localization comparing with the conventional schemes under beacon node drift scenes, which fully shows that ULES reduces average localization error under BN drift scenes."

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of irbesartan on cardiac sodium current (I-Na) in a canine model of atrial fibrillation. Materials and methods: Eighteen dogs were randomized into sham, pacing or pacing+irbesartan groups (n = 6 in each group). The dogs in the pacing and irbesartan group were paced at 500bpm for two weeks. Irbesartan (60mgkg(-1)d(-1)) was administered orally in the pacing+irbesartan groups. I-Na was recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique from canine atrial myocytes. The expressions of cardiac Na+ channels (Nav1.5) mRNA were semi-quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Our results showed that I-Na density and Nav1.5 mRNA expression in the pacing group decreased significantly (p < 0.05 vs. sham). However, rapid atrial pacing had no effects on the half-activation voltage (V-1/2act) and half-inactivation voltage (V-1/2inact) of I-Na (p > 0.05 vs. sham). Irbesartan significantly increased I-Na densities and gene expression and hyperpolarized V-1/2act without concomitant changes in V-1/2inact. Conclusions: Irbesartan significantly increased I-Na densities, which contributed to improving intra-atrial conduction and prevented the induction and promotion of AF in atrial pacing dogs."
425293800006,PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS,A fast BP networks with dynamic sample selection for handwritten recognition,"Training time of traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using back-propagation algorithm rises seriously with the problem scale. For multi-class problems, the convergence ratio is very low for training MLPs. The huge time-consuming and low convergence ratio greatly restricts the applications of MLPs on problems with tens and thousands of samples. To deal with these disadvantages, this paper proposes a fast BP network with dynamic sample selection (BPNDSS) method which can dynamically select the samples containing more contribution to the variation of the decision boundary for training after each iteration epoch. The proposed BPNDSS can significantly increase the training speed by only selecting a small subset of the whole samples. Moreover, two kinds of modular single-hidden-layer approaches are adopted to decompose a multi-class problem into multiple binary-class sub-problems, which result in the high rate of convergence. The experiments on Letter and MNIST handwritten recognition database show the effectiveness and the efficiency of BPNDSS. Moreover, BPNDSS results in comparable classification performance to the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machine, Adaboost, C4.5, and nearest neighbour algorithms. To further demonstrate the training speed improvement of the dynamic sample selection approach on large-scale datasets, we modify CNN to propose a dynamic sample selection CNN (DynCNN). Experiments on Image-Net dataset illustrate that DynCNN can result in similar performance to CNN, but consume less training time."
413313700122,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Assessing the feasibility of integrating ecosystem-based with engineered water resource governance and management for water security in semi-arid landscapes: A case study in the Banas catchment, Rajasthan, India","Much of the developing world and areas of the developed world suffer water vulnerability. Engineering solutions enable technically efficient extraction and diversion of water towards areas of demand but, without rebalancing resource regeneration, can generate multiple adverse ecological and human consequences. The Banas River, Rajasthan (India), has been extensively developed for water diversion, particularly from the Bisalpur Dam from which water is appropriated by powerful urban constituencies dispossessing local people. Coincidentally, abandonment of traditional management, including groundwater recharge practices, is leading to increasingly receding and contaminated groundwater. This creates linked vulnerabilities for rural communities, irrigation schemes, urban users, dependent ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services that they provide, compounded by climate change and population growth. This paper addresses vulnerabilities created by fragmented policy measures between rural development, urban and irrigation water supply and downstream consequences for people and wildlife. Perpetuating narrowly technocentric approaches to resource exploitation is likely only to compound emerging problems. Alternatively, restoration or innovation of groundwater recharge practices, particularly in the upper catchment, can represent a proven, ecosystem-based approach to resource regeneration with linked beneficial socio-ecological benefits. Hybridising an ecosystem-based approach with engineered methods can simultaneously increase the security of rural livelihoods, piped urban and irrigation supplies, and the vitality of river ecosystems and their services to beneficiaries. A renewed policy focus on local-scale water recharge practices balancing water extraction technologies is consistent with emerging Rajasthani policies, particularly Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan ('water self-reliance mission'). Policy reform emphasising recharge can contribute to water security and yield socio-economic outcomes through a systemic understanding of how the water system functions, and by connecting goals and budgets across multiple, currently fragmented policy areas. The underpinning principles of this necessary paradigm shift are proven and have wider geographic relevance, though context-specific research is required to underpin robust policy and practical implementation.

429172600016,IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS,High-Resolution Optical Vector Analysis Based on Symmetric Double-Sideband Modulation,"An optical vector analyzer (OVA) based on symmetric optical double-sideband (ODSB) modulation using a phase modulator (PM) and an intensity modulator (IM) is proposed and demonstrated. In the symmetric-ODSB-based OVA, frequency response measurements are implemented by transmitting the phase-modulated and intensity-modulated ODSB signals through an optical device-under-test (DUT), respectively. Then, removing the responses of the two electro-optic modulators and processing the measured responses, accurate frequency responses of the DUT on both sides of the optical carrier are obtained. Comparing with the conventional OVA based on optical single-sideband (OSSB) modulation, the proposed ODSB-based OVA has the doubled measurement range and the simple wavelength-independent configuration. Moreover, the measurement system inherently has large dynamic range and high accuracy, which is difficult to achieve for the OSSB-based OVA due to the restriction of the limited sideband suppression ratio. An experiment for measuring the magnitude and the phase responses of a programmable optical filter is carried out. The responses in a range of 100 GHz are measured with a resolution of 10 MHz by using 50-GHz components."
418731200026,OPTIK,A method for optimising settings of colour primaries for wide colour gamut displays,"Recently, wide colour gamut displays which adopt highly saturated primaries of red, green, blue have been rapidly applied. These displays can evoke more vivid and more pleasing effects for images. However, images shown on these newly developing wide gamut devices cannot achieve preferred quality under the control of conventional signal standards that are developed based on smaller colour gamut. To achieve the preferred display effects on wide gamut devices in digital image reproduction, a whole procedure to optimise gamut settings of colour primaries were proposed, in which particular algorithms were designed to render images from signal standard such as sRGB via simulating various gamut settings on the given display. Thus, the optimum specifications of colour primaries can be determined by calculations of the proposed preference index. Furthermore, a psychophysical experiment along with a detailed discussion were carried out as a verification, in which the consistence between the preference index calculation and the visual data could certify the effectiveness of the proposed procedure and algorithms. This study may help display researchers and manufactories by supporting some recommendations to determine the primaries of wide gamut devices in applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

During a 1-year period (2014) in a Rehabilitation Hospital in northwestern Italy, we approached 253 patients (19.3% of inpatients). 199 patients consented to complete a survey on job characteristics, job satisfaction, job involvement, illness perception, depression, anxiety, adherence to therapy, and sociodemographic characteristics. The data were analysed with paired sample t tests and random intercept regression models. 156 patients completed both the baseline and the 6-month follow-up assessments. After 6 months, 137 (88%) patients return to work (86% male, M age = 51.9 +/- 8.1). The patients predominantly underwent angioplasty/bypass (46%) or valve replacement/repair (38%). Work hours (WO), job satisfaction (JS), and job involvement (JI) significantly decreased after RTW (WO: t ((132)) = 2.07, p < 0.05; JS: t ((134)) = 2.56, p < 0.05; JI: t ((129)) = 4.14, p < 0.001). The decrease in work hours over time was associated with a within-subjects decrease in psychological job demands (beta = 5.107, t ((112.1)) = 2.21, p < 0.05) and job satisfaction (beta = 2.498, t ((112.92)) = 2.265, p < 0.05) and an increase in physical job demands (beta = - 1.314, t ((112.07)) = - 2.416, p < 0.05). The decrease in job satisfaction over time was related to a within-subjects decrease in decision latitude (beta = 0.505, t ((116.43)) = 2.825, p < 0.01) and an increase in psychological job demand (beta = - 0.586, t ((116.78)) = - 3.141, p < 0.01). The decrease in job involvement over time was associated with a decrease in physical job demands (beta = 0.063, t ((117.19)) = 2.157, p < 0.05) within-subjects. The study showed that many patients who RTW after angioplasty or heart surgery have poorer work experiences relative to changes in psychological and physical demands and more passive roles."
442717200005,ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE,The many outcomes from contracting out: The voice of public managers,"This paper argues that adopting a stakeholder approach to the study of contracting outcomes produces more rich and rounded representations of the realities of the contracting out of public services. We revisit the research on contracting outcomes, highlighting the public manager perspective as key for gaining deeper, more detailed insights. The public manager perspective is explored in an inductive analysis of answers to open-ended survey questions collected from public managers with contracting experience within the context of municipal park management in Scandinavia. The emerging managerial perspective is summarized in a best-case, worst-case and complex-case scenario highlighting the mix, complexities and trade-offs in a composite set of contracting outcomes. The nature of contracting outcomes as complex and composite rather than unidimensional and clear-cut is one key finding. Furthermore, the importance of some specific outcomes (e.g. learning) complements existing research themes. Our findings sustain the initial argument, demonstrating how the stakeholder approach can produce new insights. A key implication is that future research can benefit from assessing contracting outcomes by providing voice to multiple stakeholders."
442730900018,NATURE MICROBIOLOGY,A gated relaxation oscillator mediated by FrzX controls morphogenetic movements in Myxococcus xanthus,"Dynamic control of cell polarity is of critical importance for many aspects of cellular development and motility. In Myxococcus xanthus, MgIA, a G protein, and MgIB, its cognate GTPase-activating protein, establish a polarity axis that defines the direction of movement of the cell and that can be rapidly inverted by the Frz chemosensory system. Although vital for collective cell behaviours, how Frz triggers this switch has remained unknown. Here, we use genetics, imaging and mathematical modelling to show that Frz controls polarity reversals via a gated relaxation oscillator. FrzX, which we identify as a target of the Frz kinase, provides the gating and thus acts as the trigger for reversals. Slow relocalization of the polarity protein RomR then creates a refractory period during which another switch cannot be triggered. A secondary Frz output, FrzZ, decreases this delay, allowing rapid reversals when required. Thus, this architecture results in a highly tuneable switch that allows a wide range of reversal frequencies."
449130600022,SAFETY SCIENCE,Railway safety by designing the layout of inland terminals with dangerous goods connected with the rail transport system,"While rail transport is growing for medium-distance journeys, the first and last miles are travelled by road, marking a change of transport mode in inland terminals (ITs). Moreover, the introduction of ITs in seaport hinterlands is increasing with a view to decongesting ports, and the best transport mode to connect these ITs with ports is that of rail. In 2013, chemicals were involved in 48 rail accidents in the EU-28 and in 667 in the United States (US). An appropriate design for the layout of inland terminals for containers with dangerous goods (ITDGs) involved in the rail system will increase the safety and operability of rail transport, avoiding accidents such as Tianjin (2015). The novelty of this work is a methodology to design the layout of ITDGs involved in rail transport through a hierarchy of container handling equipment (CHE), used in the yard of the terminal for a safer, more resilient and more environmentally friendly rail transport. The AHP (analytic hierarchy process) was used to hierarchize five alternative layouts, one for each CHE used in the yard; and according to criteria belonging to three areas: safety and security, environment and equipment performance. Results show that a layout linked to platforms is the preferred alternative for storing containers with dangerous goods (DGs) in ITs connected to railways. The implementation of this methodology will reduce consequences in the case of a serious accident in, or terrorist attack on, ITDGs involved in the rail system and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions in the terminal."
431408500006,MARKETING INTELLIGENCE & PLANNING,Stakeholder engagement in corporate reporting: towards building a strong reputation,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which organisations engage with stakeholders about social and environmental issues. The authors establish where the designers of these reports source the information reported. Design/methodology/approach This was an exploratory study that employed a qualitative research design. Interviews with 24 individuals from 15 organisations in New Zealand that are involved with the writing of sustainability reports were conducted. In addition documents were analysed from a number of organisations to allow for triangulation. Findings Findings indicate that engagement with stakeholders was important and one of the main purposes was to have a licence to stay in business. It was also found that managers do prioritise the saliency of issues. Generally, stakeholders do not get involved in the decision making pertaining to environmental issues in organisations. Research limitations/implications The sample investigated in this study was relatively small so generalisation of the results would be difficult. However, these in depth interviews did provide insights that can be used in further study using large samples and in different countries. Originality/value This is the first time that the designers of annual reports were interviewed. They have knowledge of the extent of stakeholder engagement with firms."
442074600016,JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,Depressive symptom trajectories and physical health: Persistence of problems from adolescence to young adulthood,"Background: We examine how depressive symptom trajectories are related to adolescent and young adult subjective health, health-promoting, health-risk, and sexual risk behaviors, as well as cardiometabolic risks. Method: Data came from a community-based sample of youth (N = 662; 52% female) followed biannually, six times across 10 years. Latent class growth analysis identified four depressive symptom trajectories which were compared on adolescent (T1; ages 12-18) and young adult (T6; ages 22-29) health indicators. Results: The Low stable trajectory (49%) showed the fewest health risks. The Persistent high trajectory (9%) reported higher physical symptoms, lower physical self-concept, less physical activity and sleep, and higher rates of smoking and sexual risk behaviors than the Low stable trajectory and risks for physical symptoms, physical self-concept, and physical activity worsened in young adulthood. Increasers (21%) showed risks for physical symptoms, physical activity, and sleep in adolescence and problems for physical symptoms and physical self-concept persisted in young adulthood. Decreasers (22%) showed risks for physical symptoms, physical self-concept, physical activity, and sleep in adolescence but these risks resolved into young adulthood. Limitations: Findings may not generalize to ethnic minorities. Sex differences were not examined due to sample size limitations and most variables, except cardiometabolic risks, were self-reported. Conclusions: Findings suggest early treatment of depressive symptoms that includes strategies addressing physical symptoms, physical self-concept, and physical activity may prove beneficial. Screening youth for physical symptoms and declines in health-promoting behaviors may also identify youth at risk of depression onset and progression."

Methods: The House Brackmann (HB) grade of patients diagnosed with BP and RHS was determined at first visit and 3 months later. Final HB grade III-VI was defined as an incomplete recovery. Factors evaluated as prognostic of poor recovery included electroneurography (ENoG) degeneration rate (DR) > 90%, and absence of BR. Rates of complete and incomplete recovery were calculated and the associations between prognostic factors and recovery were determined. Results: Of the 129 included patients, 98 (76%) had BP and 31 (24%) had RHS. Absence of BR and low mean ENoG value were significantly associated with incomplete recovery in both the BP and RHS groups (p < 0.05 each). Initial HB grade V-VI was significantly associated with rate of incomplete recovery in patients with RHS (p < 0.05 each). Severe residual palsy (final HB grade V-VI) in the absence of BR was significantly more frequent in patients with RHS than with BP (p < 0.05). Conclusion: BR test results were a good prognostic indicator in patients with BP and RHS, as were ENoG value. Absence of BR was more frequently associated with severe residual palsy in RHS than in BP. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V."

439409500002,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Pechukas-Yukawa formalism for Landau-Zener transitions in the presence of external noise,"Quantum systems are prone to decoherence due to both intrinsic interactions as well as random fluctuations from the environment. Using the Pechukas-Yukawa formalism, we investigate the influence of noise on the dynamics of an adiabatically evolving Hamiltonian which can describe a quantum computer. Under this description, the level dynamics of a parametrically perturbed quantum Hamiltonian are mapped to the dynamics of one-dimensional classical gas. We show that our framework coincides with the results of the classical Landau-Zener transitions upon linearization. Furthermore, we determine the effects of external noise on the level dynamics and its impact on Landau-Zener transitions."
444355700074,ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,Carbon Dot Fluorescence-Lifetime-Encoded Anti-Counterfeiting,"Carbon dots (CDs) rank among the most promising luminescent nanomaterials for anti-counterfeiting application owing to their high fluorescence quantum yield and nontoxicity. Herein, we report a novel, high-level security performance anti-counterfeiting strategy achieved by fluorescence-lifetime-encoded CD fluorescent inks. CD-inks have identical steady-state emission properties, but they have distinctive and well-separated fluorescence lifetimes, allowing authentication of security tags using exclusively fluorescence lifetime imaging. A proof-of-concept anti-counterfeiting tag using CD-based lifetime-encoded inks is demonstrated. The developed CD lifetime-based anti counterfeit technology is awaited to be applicable to a wide spectrum of security protecting purposes. Furthermore, the presented method can be easily extended to integrate fluorescence-lifetime-encoded CDs in multichannel bioimaging, high-throughput flow cytometry, and optical data storage."

In addition, the as-prepared zirconia doped carbon fiber (ZrO2-CNF) were modified with gamma-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)propytrimethoxysilane (KH560) in order to improve the dispersion in the epoxy resin, then the ZrO2-CNF/epoxy composite coatings were prepared. The morphology and structure of ZrO2-CNF composites fiber were characterized through SEM, EDS-Mapping, TEM, FT-IR and XPS. Besides, the mechanical properties of ZrO2-CNF/ epoxy composite coatings were tested by Tensile test, and the corrosion resistance properties of the composite coatings were characterized by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization curves analysis. The results show that the ZrO2 could be doped on the CNF uniformly, and fiber with uniform size can be obtained. Then the corrosion resistance properties and mechanical properties of the ZrO2-CNF/epoxy composite coatings were enhanced effectively due to excellent hardness and corrosion resistance of ZrO2."

Methods: This was a retrospective study involving 29 patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate defects, of whom 13 were treated with palatal devices with nasal stents (PNAM group) and 16 were treated with palatal devices without nasal stents or surgical tapes (control group). Submental oblique photographs and orthodontic models were longitudinally obtained at the initial visit (T1) and immediately before (T2) and after cheiloplasty (T3). Asymmetry of the external nose, degree of columellar shifting, nasal tip/ala nose ratio, nasal base angle, interalveolar gap, and the sagittal difference in the alveolar gap were measured. The study was conducted in the Orthodontic Clinic at Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan between 1997 and 2012. Results: At T1, there were no significant intergroup differences in the first 4 asymmetry parameters. At T2, the PNAM group showed a significant improvement in all values compared to the control group. At T3, the PNAM group showed significant improvement in nasal asymmetry and columellar shifting. Model analysis showed significantly greater changes in the inter-alveolar gap and the sagittal difference of the alveolar cleft gap from T1 to T2 in the PNAM group. Conclusion: The use of PNAM is indispensable for pre-surgical orthodontic treatment at the early postnatal age."
454748900015,MBIO,Emergence and Evolution of Novel Reassortant Influenza A Viruses in Canines in Southern China,"The capacity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) to host jump from animal reservoir species to humans presents an ongoing pandemic threat. Birds and swine are considered major reservoirs of viral genetic diversity, whereas equines and canines have historically been restricted to one or two stable IAV lineages with no transmission to humans. Here, by sequencing the complete genomes of 16 lAVs obtained from canines in southern China (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region [Guangxi]) in 2013 to 2015, we demonstrate that the evolution of canine influenza viruses (CIVs) in Asian dogs is increasingly complex, presenting a potential threat to humans. First, two reassortant H1N1 virus genotypes were introduced independently from swine into canines in Guangxi, including one genotype associated with a zoonotic infection. The genomes contain segments from three lineages that circulate in swine in China: North American triple reassortant H3N2, Eurasian avian-like H1N1, and pandemic H1N1. Furthermore, the swine-origin H1N1 viruses have transmitted onward in canines and reassorted with the CIV-H3N2 viruses that circulate endemically in Asian dogs, producing three novel reassortant CIV genotypes (H1N1r, H1N2r, and H3N2r [r stands for reassortant]). CIVs from this study were collected primarily from pet dogs presenting with respiratory symptoms at veterinary clinics, but dogs in Guangxi are also raised for meat, and street dogs roam freely, creating a more complex ecosystem for CIV transmission. Further surveillance is greatly needed to understand the full genetic diversity of CIV in southern China, the nature of viral emergence and persistence in the region's diverse canine populations, and the zoonotic risk as the viruses continue to evolve. IMPORTANCE Mammals have emerged as critically underrecognized sources of influenza virus diversity, including pigs that were the source of the 2009 pandemic and bats and bovines that harbor highly divergent viral lineages. Here, we identify two reassortant IAVs that recently host switched from swine to canines in southern China, including one virus with known zoonotic potential. Three additional genotypes were generated via reassortment events in canine hosts, demonstrating the capacity of dogs to serve as ""mixing vessels."" The continued expansion of IAV diversity in canines with high human contact rates requires enhanced surveillance and ongoing evaluation of emerging pandemic threats."
432987200009,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS,Remote Distributed Vibration Sensing Through Opaque Media Using Permanent Magnets,"Vibration sensing is critical for a variety of applications from structural fatigue monitoring to understanding the modes of airplane wings. In particular, remote sensing techniques are needed for measuring the vibrations of multiple points simultaneously, assessing vibrations inside opaque metal vessels, and sensing through smoke clouds and other optically challenging environments. In this paper, we propose a method which measures high-frequency displacements remotely using changes in the magnetic field generated by permanent magnets. We leverage the unique nature of vibration tracking and use a calibrated local model technique developed specifically to improve the frequency-domain estimation accuracy. The results show that two-dimensional local models surpass the dipole model in tracking high-frequency motions. A theoretical basis for understanding the effects of electronic noise and error due to correlated variables is generated in order to predict the performance of experiments prior to implementation. Simultaneous measurements of up to three independent vibrating components are shown. The relative accuracy of the magnet-based displacement tracking with respect to the video tracking ranges from 40 to 190 mu m when the maximum displacements approach +/- 5 mm and when sensor-to-magnet distances vary from 25 to 36 mm. Last, vibration sensing inside an opaque metal vessel and mode shape changes due to damage on an aluminum beam are also studied using the wireless permanent-magnet vibration sensing scheme."
456566500013,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,Determining consistent prognostic biomarkers of overall survival and vascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Background: Potential prognostic biomarker candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are abundant, but their generalizability is unexplored. We cross-validated markers of overall survival (OS) and vascular invasion in independent datasets. Methods: The literature search yielded 318 genes related to survival and 52 related to vascular invasion. Validation was performed in three datasets (RNA-seq, n = 371; Affymetrix arrays, n = 91; Illumina gene chips, n = 135) by uni-and multivariate Cox regression and Mann-Whitney U-test, separately for Asian and Caucasian patients. Results: One hundred and eighty biomarkers remained significant in Asian and 128 in Caucasian subjects at p <0.05. After multiple testing correction BIRC5 (p =1.9 x 10(-10)), CDC20 (p = 2.5 x 10(-9)) and PLK1 (p = 3 x 10(-9)) endured as best performing genes in Asian patients; however, none remained significant in the Caucasian cohort. In a multivariate analysis, significance was reached by stage (p = 0.0018) and expression of CENPH (p = 0.0038) and CDK4 (p = 0.038). KIF18A was the only gene predicting vascular invasion in the Affymetrix and Illumina cohorts ( p = 0.003 and p = 0.025, respectively). Conclusion: Overall, about half of biomarker candidates failed to retain prognostic value and none were better than stage predicting OS. Impact: Our results help to eliminate biomarkers with limited capability to predict OS and/or vascular invasion."
432760500034,ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS,"Gold mineralization associated with Emeishan basaltic rocks: Mineralogical, geochemical, and isotopic evidences from the Lianhuashan ore field, southwestern Guizhou Province, China","A number of gold deposits are newly discovered in the Lianhuashan ore field, southwestern Guizhou Province, China. The gold orebodies are restricted to the Emeishan basaltic rocks and the interlayer fractures between the Emeishan basaltic rocks and the limestone of the Maokou Formation. Three generations of pyrite (Py0, Py1, and Py2) have been recognized in these deposits based on morphology and paragenetic relationships. Electron microprobe (EMP), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and laser-ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) analyses were carried out to characterize their chemical and sulfur isotopic compositions. The framboidal Py0 is enriched in As but depleted in most of the other trace elements. It has negative delta S-34 values of -14.5-1.9 parts per thousand, which are typical of diagenetic pyrites resulted from bacterial reduction of marine sulfate. Pyl and arsenopyrite exhibit high concentrations of Au and As, making them the most dominant auriferous minerals. They yield comparable delta S-34 values of -2.8- + 2.1 parts per thousand, consistent with the derivation of sulfur from the Emeishan basaltic rocks. Py2 is characterized by well developed oscillatory-zoned textures, that are interpreted in terms of internal self-organization processes. It contains low concentrations of Au and highly variable concentrations of As, Sb, Co, and Ni. The Py2 grains show slightly positive delta S-34 values of + 0.4- + 7.0 parts per thousand, indicating that the sulfur was mainly sourced from the Emeishan basaltic rocks with variable amounts of contamination from reduced marine sulfate. The Emeishan basaltic rocks may have provided not only ore-hosting space but also Au, S, and other associated elements for gold mineralization in the Lianhuashan ore field. Similar gold deposits are expected to be discovered in the areas of Emeishan basaltic rocks with high Au backgrounds and small thicknesses."
426839000003,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY,Distinguishing Sulfotyrosine Containing Peptides from their Phosphotyrosine Counterparts Using Mass Spectrometry,"Sulfotyrosine and phosphotyrosine are two post-translational modifications present in higher eukaryotes. A simple and direct mass spectrometry method to distinguish between these modifications is crucial to advance our understanding of the sulfoproteome. While sulfation and phosphorylation are nominally isobaric, the accurate mass of the sulfuryl moiety is 9.6 mDa less than the phosphoryl moiety. Based on this difference, we have used an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer to characterize, resolve, and distinguish between sulfotyrosine and phosphotyrosine modifications using a set of model peptides. Multiple fragmentation techniques, namely HCD, CID, ETD, ETciD, and EThcD, have been used to compare the different fragmentation behaviors between peptides modified with these species. Sulfotyrosine undergoes neutral loss using HCD and CID, but the sulfuryl moiety is largely stable under ETD. In contrast, phosphotyrosine is stable during fragmentation using all these methods. This differential stability provides a mechanism to distinguish sulfopeptides from phosphopeptides. Based on the rigorous characterization presented herein, this work serves as a model for accurate identification of phosphotyrosine and, more challenging, sulfotyrosine, in complex proteomic samples."

Five laminates of unidirectional carbon fiber-epoxy composites at different weight fractions of SiC whiskers were manufactured using hand layup vacuum bagging process. Optical and scanning electron microscopic analysis were conducted to give an insight into the fracture morphogoloy, failure mechanisms, and the energy dissipation mechanisms created by the presence of the whiskers in the composite. Experimental results showed that composites containing 5 wt% whiskers exhibited 67% increase in the crack initiation interlaminar fracture toughness Gic, whereas it exhibited 55% increase in the maximum Gm compared to pristine composite. The optical and SEM fractographs revealed a strong relation between the microstructure of the fractured surfaces and the energy release rate trend of the composites."

The AA-bark presented an amorphous structure with irregular surface and was composed mainly of lignin and holocellulose. These characteristics indicated that the adsorbent contains available sites to accommodate the dye molecules. The GV adsorption on AA-bark was favored at pH 8.0 with adsorbent dosage of 0.80 g L-1. Pseudo-nth order model was adequate to represent the adsorption kinetics of GV on AA-bark. A fast adsorption rate was verified, with the equilibrium being attained within 30 min. Equilibrium data were well represented by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacity was 305.3 mg g(-1). Adsorption was spontaneous, favorable and endothermic. AA-bark was able to treat a simulated dye house effluent, reaching color removal values of 80%. An excellent performance was found in fixed bed experiments, where the length of the mass transfer zone was only 5.38 cm and the breakthrough time was 138.5 h. AA-bark can be regenerated two times using HNO3 0.5 mol L-1. AA-bark can be used as a low-cost material to treat colored effluents in batch and fixed bed adsorption systems."
429377700013,MARINE BIOLOGY,Comparison of the rookery connectivity and migratory connectivity: insight into movement and colonization of the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in Pacific-Southeast Asia,"Integration of the rookery connectivity, which includes historical connections among rookeries, and migratory connectivity assessing dispersal or migratory routes of marine animals are important for understanding dispersal and/or migration and its effect on the formation of genetic population structure. The migratory nature and long-distance movement of sea turtles have been reported, while natal philopatry has been suggested by genetic differentiation among rookeries within a relatively narrow geographic scale. Therefore, we hypothesize that contemporary long-distance movement has a limited effect on colonization in new rookeries. This study compared the genetic relationships among rookeries and between the rookeries and foraging grounds of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in Southeast Asia. Mitochondrial control region sequences of 333 turtles from 11 rookeries were newly determined, and combination with previously reported Indo-Pacific rookeries indicated the presence of a genetic barrier in the Torres Strait and Celebes Sea (i.e. Philippines-Sulawesi). On the other hand, an analysis of newly collected 107 turtles from seven foraging sites and mixed stock analyses indicated contemporary movement across this historical genetic barrier, from Micronesian rookeries to foraging grounds in the Celebes Sea (i.e. Sipadan Island and Tun Sakaran Marine Park). Isolation by distance was generally supported for relationships among rookeries, and the high migratory connectivity did not result in a lower genetic distance between rookeries than predicted from geographic distance. Differences between rookery connectivity and migratory connectivity in green turtles in Southeast Asia are likely due to migration to natal regions after long-distance movement."

In this article, we propose a novel algorithm to compute the signature of a system with exchangeable components. This new algorithm relies only on the information of minimal cut sets or minimal path sets, which is very intuitive and efficient. The new results in this article are used to address the problem of the aging property of the system signature in the literature. We further discuss the bounds for the system signature when only partial information is available. The application of these new results to cyberattacks is also highlighted."
434239200019,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,Dynamic selection of normalization techniques using data complexity measures,Data preprocessing is an important step for designing classification model. Normalization is one of the preprocessing techniques used to handle the out-of-bounds attributes. This work develops 14 classification models using different learning algorithms for dynamic selection of normalization technique. This work extracts 12 data complexity measures for 48 datasets drawn from the KEEL dataset repository. Each of these datasets is normalized using min-max and z-score normalization technique. G-mean index is estimated for these normalized datasets using Gaussian Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) in order to determine the best-suited normalization technique. The data complexity measures along with the best suited normalization technique are used as an input for developing the aforementioned dynamic models. These models predict the best suitable normalization technique based on the estimated data complexity measures of the dataset The result shows that the model developed using Gaussian Kernel ELM (KELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) give promising results for most of the evaluated classification problems.

451329500004,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Testing nonclassicality with exact Wigner currents for an anharmonic quantum system,"Phase-space features of the Wigner flow for an anharmonic quantum system driven by the harmonic oscillator potential modified by the addition of an inverse square (one-dimensional Coulomb-like) contribution are analytically described in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. Reporting about three correlated continuity equations which quantify the flux of quantum information in the phase space, the nonclassicality profile of such an anharmonic system can be consistently obtained in terms of the fluxes of probability, purity, and von Neumann-like entropy. Considering that quantum fluctuations can be identified from distortions over the classical regime, they can be quantified through the above-mentioned information fluxes whenever some classically bounded volume of the phase space is selected. Our results suggest that the Wigner flow approach works as a probe of quantumness and classicality for a large set of anharmonic quantum systems driven by quantum wells."

Surgery in these cases could even worsen the prognosis. We present the case of a male infant, ex-preterm, with a history of necrotizing enterocolitis and ileal perforation at birth, requiring laparotomy and intestinal resection on two occasions and developing a secondary microcolon, due to disuse. At six months, after transitioning to full oral feeding, he presented abdominal distension with extensive intestinal pneumatosis and pneumoperitoneum on radiographs. His general appearance was good with normal intestinal transit and no peritonitis. The patient remained fasting with intravenous antibiotics, nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The evolution was favourable with oral feeding restarting on the seventh day of admission. The existence of pneumoperitoneum does not always require a laparotomy and global assessment of the patient by an interdisciplinary health team may avoid unnecessary aggressive treatments."
430864100001,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,Magnesium Oxide Nanoparticles: Effective Agricultural Antibacterial Agent Against Ralstonia solanacearum,"Magnesium (Mg) is an essential mineral element for plants and is nontoxic to organisms. In this study, we took advantage of nanotechnologies to systematically investigate the antibacterial mechanisms of magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgONPs) against the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum (R. solanacearum) in vitro and in vivo for the first time. R. solanacearum has contributed to catastrophic bacterial wilt, which has resulted in the world-wide reduction of tobacco production. The results demonstrated that MgONPs possessed statistically significant concentration-dependent antibacterial activity, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were measured as 200 and 250 m g/mL, respectively. Additional studies, aimed at understanding the toxicity mechanism of MgONPs, indicated that physical injury occurred to the cell membranes, along with decreased motility and biofilm formation ability of R. solanacearum, due to the direct attachment of MgONPs to the surfaces of the bacterial cells, which was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation could also be an important reason for the antibacterial action, inducing DNA damage. The toxicity assessment assay under greenhouse conditions demonstrated that the MgONPs had exerted a large effect on tobacco bacterial wilt, reducing the bacterial wilt index. Altogether, the results suggest that the development of MgONPs as alternative antibacterial agents will become a new research subject."

Recent findings have suggested a number of additional minor autoantigens in patients with type 1 diabetes. We have established luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) for anti-MTIF3, anti-PPIL2, anti-NUP50 and anti-MLH1 and analyzed samples from 500 patients with type 1 diabetes at onset of clinical disease and 200 healthy individuals who had a family history of type 1 diabetes but no evidence of beta cell autoantibodies. We show significantly higher frequencies of anti-MTIF3, anti-PPIL2 and anti-MLH1 in recent onset type 1 diabetes patients in comparison to controls. In addition, antibodies to NUP50 were associated with HLA-DRB1(star)03 and antibodies to MLH1 were associated with HLA-DRB1(star)04 genotypes."

425107700015,POLYMER BULLETIN,Aging of silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives,"Silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives (Si-PSA) exhibit unique properties, such as high Si-O-Si backbone flexibility, low intermolecular interactions, low surface tension, excellent thermal stability, and high UV transparency, which often explains why silicone PSAs have an impressive performance at high- and low-temperature extremes, excellent electrical properties, chemical resistance, and outstanding weathering resistance turning them superior compared to organic PSAs. It is well known that due to their unique properties, silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives are materials for special applications. In the present study, we focus on changing the useful properties of the best compositions of silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives in time to verify the impact of aging on them. The influence of time on given silicone pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes and their useful properties is a very important factor for the description of the life-time of potential products based on such compositions. Aging of Si-PSA was carried out for 1 h, 24 h, 7 days, 31 days, and 92 days. The tests did include such properties like adhesion, cohesion (at 20 and 70 A degrees C), tack, and yellowness."

This study aimed to evaluate the multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal effects and associated mechanisms of LS-2-3j in drug-resistant cancer cells. The inhibition of cell proliferation in tested agents was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Accumulation or efflux of chemotherapy drugs was analyzed by flow cytometry. The ATPase activity was measured using an ATPase activity assay kit. The mRNA transcripts and protein expression levels were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. In this connection, LS-2-3j significantly enhanced the activity of chemotherapeutic drugs in MDR cells and could significantly increase the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin (DOX) and mitoxantrone (MITX) by inhibiting the function of the efflux pumps in ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, reduced ATPase activity, mRNA transcription, and protein expression levels of ABCB1 and ABCG2 were observed in a concentration dependent manner in MDR cancer cells."
447265300001,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,Web-Based Information Infrastructure Increases the Interrater Reliability of Medical Coders: Quasi-Experimental Study,"Background: Medical coding is essential for standardized communication and integration of clinical data. The Unified Medical Language System by the National Library of Medicine is the largest clinical terminology system for medical coders and Natural Language Processing tools. However, the abundance of ambiguous codes leads to low rates of uniform coding among different coders. Objective: The objective of our study was to measure uniform coding among different medical experts in terms of interrater reliability and analyze the effect on interrater reliability using an expert- and Web-based code suggestion system. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental study in which 6 medical experts coded 602 medical items from structured quality assurance forms or free-text eligibility criteria of 20 different clinical trials. The medical item content was selected on the basis of mortality-leading diseases according to World Health Organization data. The intervention comprised using a semiautomatic code suggestion tool that is linked to a European information infrastructure providing a large medical text corpus of >300,000 medical form items with expert-assigned semantic codes. Krippendorff alpha (K-alpha) with bootstrap analysis was used for the interrater reliability analysis, and coding times were measured before and after the intervention. Results: The intervention improved interrater reliability in structured quality assurance form items (from K-alpha 0.50, 95% CI 0.43-0.57 to K-alpha=0.62 95% CI 0.55-0.69) and free-text eligibility criteria (from K-alpha=0.19, 95% CI 0.14-0.24 to K-alpha=0.43, 95% CI 0.37-0.50) while preserving or slightly reducing the mean coding time per item for all 6 coders. Regardless of the intervention, precoordination and structured items were associated with significantly high interrater reliability, but the proportion of items that were precoordinated significantly increased after intervention (eligibility criteria: OR 4.92, 95% CI 2.78-8.72; quality assurance: OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.19-3.25). Conclusions: The Web-based code suggestion mechanism improved interrater reliability toward moderate or even substantial intercoder agreement. Precoordination and the use of structured versus free-text data elements are key drivers of higher interrater reliability."
434094400019,ECOLOGY,Microbial decomposers not constrained by climate history along a Mediterranean climate gradient in southern California,"Microbial decomposers mediate the return of CO2 to the atmosphere by producing extracellular enzymes to degrade complex plant polymers, making plant carbon available for metabolism. Determining if and how these decomposer communities are constrained in their ability to degrade plant litter is necessary for predicting how carbon cycling will be affected by future climate change. We analyzed mass loss, litter chemistry, microbial biomass, extracellular enzyme activities, and enzyme temperature sensitivities in grassland litter transplanted along a Mediterranean climate gradient in southern California. Microbial community composition was manipulated by caging litter within bags made of nylon membrane that prevent microbial immigration. To test whether grassland microbes were constrained by climate history, half of the bags were inoculated with local microbial communities native to each gradient site. We determined that temperature and precipitation likely interact to limit microbial decomposition in the extreme sites along our gradient. Despite their unique climate history, grassland microbial communities were not restricted in their ability to decompose litter under different climate conditions across the gradient, although microbial communities across our gradient may be restricted in their ability to degrade different types of litter. We did find some evidence that local microbial communities were optimized based on climate, but local microbial taxa that proliferated after inoculation into litterbags did not enhance litter decomposition. Our results suggest that microbial community composition does not constrain C-cycling rates under climate change in our system, but optimization to particular resource environments may act as more general constraints on microbial communities."
439916400008,JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH,The impact of night-shift work on platelet function in healthy medical staff,"Objectives: Rotating shift work has been reported to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Vascular endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation are among the leading causes of thrombus formation in patients with myocardial infarction or stroke. Endothelial function has been shown to be impaired immediately after night-shift work, however, it is not known whether platelets are also activated. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute impact of night-shift work on platelet function. Methods: This observational study included 11 healthy medical staff members (seven women, median age 32 years). We examined each subject's platelet aggregation rates and the serum concentrations of eicosanoid mediators after night-shift work and on dayshift work without preceding night-shift work (baseline). Results: Platelet aggregation did not differ from baseline levels after night-shift work. However, serum cyclooxygenase (COX)-metabolized eicosanoid mediators, particularly thromboxane (Tx) B-2 (a stable metabolite of TxA(2) and the most important marker of platelet activation), were significantly higher after the night-shift than at baseline (median 65.3 vs 180.4 ng/m/). Conclusions: Although platelet aggregation did not increase, there was an increase in serum COX-metabolized eicosanoid mediators such as TxB(2) in healthy medical staff after night-shift work. This platelet hypersensitivity may be one of the mechanisms underlying the significant association between night-shift work and adverse cardiovascular outcomes."
427727900007,JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL WRITING,"""Keeping my slave side well versed"": Fred D'Aguiar's use of ottava rima in Bloodlines","This article explores Fred D'Aguiar's use of ottava rima in his novel in verse Bloodlines. It considers poetry as a minority genre within postcolonial writing and ottava rima as a minority form within the genre of poetry. D'Aguiar's choice of form can be examined in relation to his subject, which is the rape of a black slave by a white man, the love that follows the rape and the consequences of their relationship. The article approaches the form of the poem from two perspectives. First, it contends that the deliberate foregrounding of form emphasizes the literary connection to the past, using figures of rhetoric to express the paradoxical nature of slavery; second, it calls upon the concept of voice, used in psychoanalysis as a notion covering both sound and sense, to show how D'Aguiar mobilizes the resources of sound and rhyme to explore the emotional impact of his story."
424954100020,COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS,Non-equilibrium micelles formed by sugar-based surfactants under their Krafft temperature,"Sugar-based surfactants are renewable substitutes to petroleum-based ones as wetting, dispersing and emulsifying agents in the formulation industry. In a substitution approach, knowledge of physico-chemical properties (e. g. critical micelle concentration - CMC - or minimum surface tension) of the sugar-based surfactant candidates is crucial. However, conflicting physico-chemical properties, such as widely different CMC and surface tensions at CMC (gamma CMC) can be published about of a given surfactant. Such conflict is illustrated and investigated for two surfactants as case studies, octyl-alpha-D-glucoside and dodecyl-beta-D-glucoside surfactants, which have typical behavior and a Krafft temperature (Tk, which characterizes the solubility of solid surfactant) above room temperature. Tensiometry curves have been measured and discussed for a range of surfactant solutions prepared using different temperature conditions. Complementary methods such as colorimetry, spectrophotometry and dynamic light scattering were used in combination with tensiometry curves. Overall, this study evidences the persistence of out of equilibrium micelles below Tk for a noticeable time on realistic experimental conditions, for both octyl-alpha-D-glucoside and dodecyl-beta-D-glucoside surfactants, as a potential explanation for the conflicting CMC and surface tensions at CMC published in literature. This study evidences that investigating the solubility of the surfactant in water as represented by Tk to complement tensiometric curves analysis is important to confirm the derived CMC and gamma CMC values."
427999600010,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY,Outcomes of adenoidectomy-alone in patients less than 3-years old,"Objectives: 1. Determine the percentage of patients under the age of 3 undergoing adenoidectomy-alone who require subsequent management of residual sleep disordered breathing (SDB).2. Characterize complications following adenoidectomy and determine if any perioperative factors are associated with intra-operative or postoperative complications and outcomes. Methods: Case series with chart review was conducted including children seen at a tertiary care children's hospital between 2008 and 2012. Consecutive patients under the age of 3 who underwent adenoidectomy-alone were identified by billing codes. After excluding those with syndromes, partial adenoidectomies, and those without follow-up, 148 patients were included. Predictors of requiring additional surgery for SDB were evaluated using log-rank tests or Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Median age at time of initial adenoidectomy was 27.5 months (range 11-36 months) and the patient population was comprised of 66.2% males (n = 98/148) and 89.2% Caucasians (n = 132/148). 56.5% (n = 74/131) of patients continued to have residual symptoms of SDB and 34.5% (n = 51/148) underwent additional surgical intervention. Multivariable survival analysis revealed GERD (HR, 6.21; CI, 1.29-29.77, p = .022) and tonsil size (HR, 4.07; CI, 1.57-10.51, p = .004) were significant predictors of additional surgery in this group of patients under the age of 3. There was no observed difference in intra- and post-operative complication rates between patients with and without additional operative intervention. Conclusions: Residual SDB symptoms following adenoidectomy in patients less than 3 years of age are common and require additional surgery at a high rate. Medical comorbidities such as GERD and large tonsil size may help predict the need for additional surgery."
433989600003,MARINE GEORESOURCES & GEOTECHNOLOGY,DEM analysis of granular crushing during simple shearing,"In this study, simple shear tests on breakable polydisperse granular materials were simulated using two-dimensional discrete element method (DEM). A new technique of generating polydisperse DEM samples with a smooth and continuous particle size distribution curve was proposed. A modified breakage criterion was introduced to reflect the contact force anisotropy of particles in the numerical sample. The simulation results showed that during the simple shearing, grain crushing in the sample mainly occurred in the contraction process and decreased gradually when the sample began to dilate. As the shearing proceeded to a larger strain, the grain crushing tended to a stable value. This grain crushing trend was in accordance with the evolution of the average normal contact forces of particles in the sample during shearing. The average normal contact forces of potential breakage particles increased in the contraction process and decreased in the dilatancy process. A decrease in the average normal contact forces of potential breakage particles resulted in the decrease in grain crushing during the later stage of shearing."
422743000001,MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES,Chemical genomic guided engineering of gamma-valerolactone tolerant yeast,"Background: Gamma valerolactone (GVL) treatment of lignocellulosic bomass is a promising technology for degradation of biomass for biofuel production; however, GVL is toxic to fermentative microbes. Using a combination of chemical genomics with the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) deletion collection to identify sensitive and resistant mutants, and chemical proteomics to monitor protein abundance in the presence of GVL, we sought to understand the mechanism toxicity and resistance to GVL with the goal of engineering a GVL-tolerant, xylose-fermenting yeast. Results: Chemical genomic profiling of GVL predicted that this chemical affects membranes and membrane-bound processes. We show that GVL causes rapid, dose-dependent cell permeability, and is synergistic with ethanol. Chemical genomic profiling of GVL revealed that deletion of the functionally related enzymes Pad1p and Fdc1p, which act together to decarboxylate cinnamic acid and its derivatives to vinyl forms, increases yeast tolerance to GVL. Further, overexpression of Pad1p sensitizes cells to GVL toxicity. To improve GVL tolerance, we deleted PAD1 and FDC1 in a xylose-fermenting yeast strain. The modified strain exhibited increased anaerobic growth, sugar utilization, and ethanol production in synthetic hydrolysate with 1.5% GVL, and under other conditions. Chemical proteomic profiling of the engineered strain revealed that enzymes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis were more abundant in the presence of GVL compared to the background strain. The engineered GVL strain contained greater amounts of ergosterol than the background strain. Conclusions: We found that GVL exerts toxicity to yeast by compromising cellular membranes, and that this toxicity is synergistic with ethanol. Deletion of PAD1 and FDC1 conferred GVL resistance to a xylose-fermenting yeast strain by increasing ergosterol accumulation in aerobically grown cells. The GVL-tolerant strain fermented sugars in the presence of GVL levels that were inhibitory to the unmodified strain. This strain represents a xylose fermenting yeast specifically tailored to GVL produced hydrolysates."
417773800004,OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,Portfolio analysis with DEA: Prior to choosing a model,"This paper aims at providing answers to the questions raised in Cook et al. (2014) in the context of portfolio analysis with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). This reflection leads to define the financial production process as the generation of a distribution of returns by an initial investment. The main contribution of the paper is therefore to consider risks of various orders-mean return, variance of returns, and moments of higher order-as output variables and propose a set of axioms accordingly to supplement the definition of 'financial' technology set. In particular, this revisited set of axioms offers the advantage of allowing a generalization to multi-moment frameworks, and the resulting portfolio possibility set allows taking into account preferences for increases in risk that have remained ignored in applied studies with DEA although discussed in economic theory. We provide illustrations to show the effects of this contribution on the measures of technical efficiency and ranking of portfolios on a sample set of US common stocks; it shows how the proposed adjustments result in providing rankings that are more consistent with standard risk-return ratios in finance.

423839100005,CHINESE PHYSICS C,Locating the QCD critical end point through peaked baryon number susceptibilities along the freeze-out line,"We investigate the baryon number susceptibilities up to fourth order along different freeze-out lines in a holographic QCD model with a critical end point (CEP), and we propose that the peaked baryon number susceptibilities along the freeze-out line can be used as a clean signature to locate the CEP in the QCD phase diagram. On the temperature and baryon chemical potential plane, the cumulant ratio of the baryon number susceptibilities (up to fourth order) forms a ridge along the phase boundary, and develops a sword-shaped ""mountain"" standing upright around the CEP in a narrow and oblate region. The measurement of baryon number susceptibilities from heavy-ion collision experiments is along the freeze-out line. If the freeze-out line crosses the foot of the CEP mountain, then one can observe the peaked baryon number susceptibilities along the freeze-out line, and the kurtosis of the baryon number distributions has the highest magnitude. The data from the first phase of the beam energy scan program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider indicates that there should be a peak of the kurtosis of the baryon number distribution at a collision energy of around 5 GeV, which suggests that the freeze-out line crosses the foot of the CEP mountain and the summit of the CEP should be located nearby, around a collision energy of 3-7 GeV."
447788500009,LUPUS,"Pneumonia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: Epidemiology, microbiology and outcomes","Background and objective Pneumonia remains the main cause of mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim of the study was to establish the clinical characteristics, microbiology and risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with SLE and pneumonia. Methods We reviewed medical records of patients with SLE (American College of Rheumatology criteria) and pneumonia who attended the emergency room in a single tertiary care center (January 2010-March 2015). We collected demographics, treatment and disease activity (SLEDAI-2K) data. Severity scales of pneumonia (CURB-65 (acronym for risk factors measured: confusion, urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 65 years of age and older) and Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)) were obtained. A negative composite outcome was defined as need for mechanical ventilation, septic shock or death secondary to pneumonia up to 30 days after discharge. We conducted a univariate and multivariable analysis. Results We studied 158 patients (76% women) with 187 episodes of pneumonia. There were no differences in age, SLE duration, SLE activity, treatment or comorbidities between patients with negative composite outcome vs the other group. In 53 episodes, patients presented with a negative composite outcome. Of these, 46 (24.6%) required intubation, 13 (7%) developed shock and 12 (6.4%) died. The most common bacteria isolated was S. aureus, and we observed a high percentage of nonhabitual microorganisms. Fifteen percent of patients who presented with a negative outcome had low values on CURB-65 and PSI scales. Conclusion Patients with SLE and pneumonia have a high risk of complications and present with a high percentage of nonhabitual microorganisms. Severity scales for pneumonia can misclassify as low risk SLE patients with poor prognosis."
444461900003,CYTOMETRY PART A,Background fluorescence and spreading error are major contributors of variability in high-dimensional flow cytometry data visualization by t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding,"Multidimensional single-cell analysis requires approaches to visualize complex data in intuitive 2D graphs. In this regard, t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (tSNE) is the most popular algorithm for single-cell RNA sequencing and cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), but its application to polychromatic flow cytometry, including the recently developed 30-parameter platform, is still under investigation. We identified differential distribution of background values between samples, generated by either background calculation or spreading error (SE), as a major source of variability in polychromatic flow cytometry data representation by tSNE, ultimately resulting in the identification of erroneous heterogeneity among cell populations. Biexponential transformation of raw data and limiting SE during panel development dramatically improved data visualization. These aspects must be taken into consideration when using computational approaches as discovery tools in large sets of samples from independent experiments or immunomonitoring in clinical trials."
455325000010,GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,Ancient Endogenous Pararetroviruses in Oryza Genomes Provide Insights into the Heterogeneity of Viral Gene Macroevolution,"Endogenous viral sequences in eukaryotic genomes, such as those derived from plant pararetroviruses (PRVs), can serve as genomic fossils to study viral macroevolution. Many aspects of viral evolutionary rates are heterogeneous, including substitution rate differences between genes. However, the evolutionary dynamics of this viral gene rate heterogeneity (GRH) have been rarely examined. Characterizing such GRH may help to elucidate viral adaptive evolution. In this study, based on robust phylogenetic analysis, we determined an ancient endogenous PRV group in Oryza genomes in the range of being 2.41-15.00 Myr old. We subsequently used this ancient endogenous PRV group and three younger groups to estimate the GRH of PRVs. Long-term substitution rates for the most conserved gene and a divergent gene were 2.69 x 10(-8) to 8.07 x 10(-8) and 4.72 x 10(-8) to 1.42 x 10(-7) substitutions/site/year, respectively. On the basis of a direct comparison, a long-term GRH of 1.83-fold was identified between these two genes, which is unexpectedly low and lower than the short-term GRH (>3.40-fold) of PRVs calculated using published data. The lower long-term GRH of PRVs was due to the slightly faster rate decay of divergent genes than of conserved genes during evolution. To the best of our knowledge, we quantified for the first time the long-term GRH of viral genes using paleovirological analyses, and proposed that the GRH of PRVs might be heterogeneous on time scales (time-dependent GRH). Our findings provide special insights into viral gene macroevolution and should encourage a more detailed examination of the viral GRH."

To analyze this, a surface potential-based compact model for gate induced noise is developed. The model is validated by comparing with TCAD device simulation results as well as with the available experimental data of GaN HEMT and MOS-HEMT having different gate lengths and widths from the literature. With the help of the developed model, the effect of oxide thickness on different noise sources is investigated by considering all high-frequency noise sources including the shot noise resulted from gate leakage current. The effects of gate leakage current on different technology dependent parameters such as oxide thickness and gate length are also investigated. A 2-port noise equivalent circuit for GaN MOS-HEMT is designed by considering all high-frequency noise sources. The different noise parameter models are developed from the Y parameters of the 2-port noise equivalent circuit and compared with available experimental data of GaN HEMT and MOS-HEMT from literature. The impact of gate induced noise on all noise parameters is also investigated."
419419800027,MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS,Inhibition of Human CYP3A4 by Rationally Designed Ritonavir-Like Compounds: Impact and Interplay of the Side Group Functionalities,"Structure function relationships of nine rationally designed ritonavir-like compounds were investigated to better understand the ligand binding and inhibitory mechanism in human drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The analogs had a similar backbone and pyridine and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) as the heme-ligating and terminal groups, respectively. N-Isopropyl, N-cyclopentyl, or N-phenyl were the Rrside group substituents alone (compounds 5a-c) or in combination with phenyl or indole at the R-2 position (8a-c and 8d-f subseries, respectively). Our experimental and structural data indicate that (i) for all analogs, a decrease in the dissociation constant (K-s,) coincides with a decrease in IC50, but no relation with other derived parameters is observed; (ii) an increase in the R-1 volume, hydrophobicity, and aromaticity markedly lowers K-s and IC50, whereas the addition of aromatic R-2 has a more pronounced positive effect on the inhibitory potency than the binding strength; (iii) the ligands' association mode is strongly influenced by the mutually dependent R-1 R-2 interplay, but the R-1 -mediated interactions are dominant and define the overall conformation in the active site; (iv) formation of a strong H-bond with Ser119 is a prerequisite for potent CYP(3)A(4) inhibition; and (v) the strongest inhibitor in the series, the R-1-phenyl/R-2-indole containing 8f (K-s and ICso of 0.08 and 0.43 mu M, respectively), is still less potent than ritonavir, even under conditions that prevent the mechanism based inactivation of CYP(3)A(4). Crystallographic data were essential for better understanding and interpretation of the experimental results, and suggested how the inhibitor design could be further optimized."
450517900001,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH,Inflammation markers and cognitive performance in breast cancer survivors 20 years after completion of chemotherapy: a cohort study,"BackgroundInflammation is an important candidate mechanism underlying cancer and cancer treatment-related cognitive impairment. We investigated levels of blood cell-based inflammatory markers in breast cancer survivors on average 20 years after chemotherapy and explored the relation between these markers and global cognitive performance.MethodsOne hundred sixty-six breast cancer survivors who received post-surgical radiotherapy and six cycles of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy on average 20 years before enrollment were compared with 1344 cancer-free women from a population-based sample (50-80 years old). Breast cancer survivors were excluded if they used adjuvant hormonal therapy or if they developed relapse, metastasis, or second primary malignancies. Systemic inflammation status was assessed by the granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII).Cognitive performance was assessed using an extensive neuropsychological test battery from which the general cognitive factor was derived to evaluate global cognitive performance. We examined the association between cancer, the general cognitive factor, and inflammatory markers using linear regression models.ResultsBreast cancer survivors had a lower general cognitive factor than non-exposed participants from the comparator group (mean difference = -0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to -0.06). Inflammatory markers were higher in cancer survivors compared with non-exposed participants (mean difference for log(GLR) = 0.31; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.37, log(PLR) = 0.14; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.19, log(SII) = 0.31; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.39). The association between higher levels of inflammatory markers and lower general cognitive factor was statistically significant in cancer survivors but not among non-exposed participants. We found a group-by-inflammatory marker interaction; cancer survivors showed additional lower general cognitive factor per standard deviation increase in inflammatory markers (P for interaction for GLR = 0.038, PLR = 0.003, and SII = 0.033).ConclusionsThis is the first study to show that (1) cancer survivors have increased levels of inflammation on average 20 years after treatment and (2) these inflammatory levels are associated with lower cognitive performance. Although this association needs verification by a prospective study to determine causality, our findings can stimulate research on the role of inflammation in long-term cognitive problems and possibilities to diminish such problems."
433999000019,ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE,Supplemental flaxseed modulates ovarian functions of weanling gilts via the action of selected fatty acids,"The aim of this study was to examine the influence of dietary flaxseed on the endocrine and ovarian functions of weanling gilts challenged with E. coli and Coronavirus infections treated with dietary probiotic cheeses and to understand the possible mechanisms of its effects on ovarian function. Probiotics were used as a natural substitution for antibiotics and 10% dietary flaxseed is an effective prebiotic which supports the action of probiotics and has other beneficial effects on the organism. Probiotics with or without flaxseed were fed to weanling gilts starting 10 days before and lasting up until 14 days after weaning. The ovaries were measured and histologically analysed. The blood samples for the levels of steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were assessed using immunoassays and the levels of fatty acids were assessed using gas chromatography. All samples were collected on the day of weaning and 14 days after weaning. On the day of weaning, increased levels of linoleic acid and IGF-I was associated with higher body weight. The steroid hormones were not affected by the diet. The conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to timodonic (EPA) and cervonic (DHA) acids were lower compared to controls, and together with high levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids was associated with the higher proliferation and lower apoptosis in the primordial, primary and secondary follicles; although the inhibition of the cell cycle was observed in relation to the low level of eicosadienoic acid. The high levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and the low levels of myristic, palmitic and palmitoleic acids may have been the effect of flaxseed feeding 14 days post-weaning and may have had a reverse effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian follicles. These data suggest that flaxseed may suppress the follicle development in weanlings via the stimulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation via the modulation of the metabolism of selected fatty acids."
418988500004,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE,A coupled hyperelastic-plastic-continuum damage model for studying cyclic behavior of unfilled engineering polymers,"History of accumulated fatigue damage and induced plastic strain are salient design criteria in many structural elements in aerospace, automotive and healthcare industries. A successful fatigue engineering tool should be able to predict the cyclic permanent set as well as the fatigue damage, and lifetime. When an engineering polymer is subjected to cyclic loads, the unloading curves may deviate from the so-called linear unloading response. It is argued that previously developed fatigue computational tools, e.g. Shojaei and Wedgewood (2017) and Shojaei and Volgers (2017), might overpredict the residual plastic strain in real applications. This work aims at accommodating the observed nonlinear unloading curves into the previously developed fatigue modeling framework that significantly improves the predicted permanent deformation. To accomplish this task a hyper-elastic material model is coupled with plasticity, and Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM). The developed hyperelastic-plastic-CDM framework is implemented in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, viz. Abaqus, through user-defined material laws for structural analysis. The hyperelastic material model within the small strain framework can effectively capture elastic loading and unloading responses. The enforced coupling between hyperelastic, plastic, and CDM models results in more accurate prediction of the progressive fatigue damage and permanent set in unfilled polymers. The performance of the developed framework is compared with the experimental data and it is shown that the developed framework performs well in capturing progressive permanent set, and fatigue damage in unfilled polymers. The proposed framework may improve the precision of cyclic analysis in unfilled polymers and may help engineers in their design optimization cycles."
451994900025,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION,A Low-Profile Coplanar Dual-Polarized and Dual-Band Base Station Antenna Array,"This paper presents a low-profile coplanar dual-polarized dual-band base station antenna array. A slotted patch antenna operating from 0.82 to 0.99 GHz with four shorting strips is proposed and analyzed. The four shorting strips are employed not only to improve the impedance matching in the lower band but also to remove the center part of the patch, thus making room for higher band dipoles operating from 1.68 to 2.86 GHz. The height of the proposed array is nearly half of the conventional base station array while other performances are guaranteed. The measured results show that the proposed antenna array has wide impedance bandwidths of 18.7% (0.82-0.99 GHz) and 57.9% (1.68-2.86 GHz) (VSWR < 2) with a low profile (0.109 lambda(0) at 820 MHz). The measured gains are 13.8 +/- 0.5 dB and 16.7 +/- 1 dB in lower and upper bands. Large front-to-back ratio (>24.6 dB) and high isolations (>30 and >25 dB in lower and upper bands, respectively) are achieved. The proposed antenna can be easily built with printed circuit board fabrication technique and applied in low profile multiband base stations for 2G/3G/4G and the next-generation systems."
446033800009,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,Uncivil and personal? Comparing patterns of incivility in comments on the Facebook pages of news outlets,"Social media and its embedded user commentary are playing increasingly influential roles in the news process. However, researchers' understanding of the social media commenting environment remains limited, despite rising concerns over uncivil comments. Accordingly, this study used a supervised machine learning-based method of content analysis to examine the extent and patterns of incivility in the comment sections of 42 US news outlets' Facebook pages over an 18-month period in 2015-2016. These outlets were selected as being broadly representative of national, local, conservative, and liberal-news media. The findings provide the first empirical evidence that both the level and the targets of incivility in the comments posted on news outlets' Facebook pages vary greatly according to such entities' general type and ideological stance."
424317100023,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,"Fertility, household size and poverty in Nepal","Population control policies keep attracting attention: by increasing the household size, having more children would directly contribute to a household's poverty. Using nationally representative household level data from Nepal, we investigate the links between a household's fertility decisions and variations in their size and composition. We show that the relationship between number of births and household size is positive when the mothers are young, but becomes negative as the mothers grow older. Elderly couples who had fewer children host, on average, more relatives who are outside the immediate family unit. This result sheds light on the heterogeneous relation between the number of children and household size over the life cycle. It also implies that reductions in a household's fertility may have an ambiguous impact on its per capita consumption, which depends on how the household's composition responds to new births and changes over time: in this sample, an old household's per capita consumption is not affected by the number of births. We use the gender of the first-born child to instrument the total number of consecutive children. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
438661500021,INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES,"Integrated assessment of heavy metal contamination in water, sediments and marine organisms from Southeast coast of India","The present investigation examined the bioaccumulation of toxic metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb) in water, sediment and biota along the coastal regions of Parangipettai and Nagapattinam. The concentrations of heavy metals in water, sediment and biota were Zn>Pb>Cu>Hg>Cd, Cu>Zn>Pb>Cd>Hg and Zn>Cu>Pb>Hg>Cd, respectively. Statistical analysis, such as principal component analysis revealed that concentrations of Zn, Cu and Pb were found higher in water, sediments and biota at Parangipettai (St. 1). Geospatial analyses were made to study the spatial distribution of heavy metals and its sources in study sites observed. Accumulation factors of abiota and biota were identified by the domination of higher values than the average background values and followed by the comparison with the trace metals from other coastal regions in the southeast coast of India. The result of the present study shows that the Parangipettai region had higher pollutants than that of Nagapattinam."
455021000018,FARADAY DISCUSSIONS,The influence of aqueous solvent on the electronic structure and non-adiabatic dynamics of indole explored by liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy,"Understanding how the electronic structure of an aqueous solute is intricately bound up with the arrangement of a host liquid provides insight into how non-adiabatic photochemistry takes place in the condensed phase. For example, the presence of water provides additional solute-solvent interactions compared to non-polar solvents: changing the stability of ionized products and modifying the energies of low-lying excited valence states, as well as moving the point of intersection between potential surfaces. Thus, the locations and topography of conical intersections between these surfaces also change. The overall impact of the aqueous environment can be to modify the intricate photochemical and non-radiative pathways taking place after photoexcitation. Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) in a liquid micro-jet is implemented here to investigate the influence of water on the electronic structure and dynamics of indole, the chromophore of the amino acid tryptophan. TRPES is used to establish ultrafast relaxation pathways that vary as a function of excitation wavelength. In our experiment, aqueous indole was excited with femtosecond pulses centered at 292 nm and 266 nm. The vertical excitation energy of aqueous indole is extracted and found to be lowered by 0.5 eV in water relative to the gas phase. In the TRPES study, the spectral signature of L-1(a) and evidence of solvated electron formation on an ultrafast timescale are observed. Our data also points to a possible contribution of the dissociative sigma* state, which can be accessed by a conical intersection (CI) with the L-1(a) state."
428482100003,EMERGING MARKETS REVIEW,Extreme dependence and risk spillovers between oil and Islamic stock markets,"This paper examines the downside and upside risk spillovers and dependence structure between five Islamic stock markets (the Islamic Market World index, Islamic indices of USA, UK, Japan and the Islamic Financials sector index) which are of paramount importance for faith-oriented investors and particpants in the oil market The results underscore the presence of time-varying lower tail dependence between the oil and Islamic stock markets. Furthermore, we provide supportive evidence of asymmetric down-and up-side risk spillovers from oil to the Islamic stock markets and vice versa. Finally, these asymmetric risk spillovers have significantly increased after the global financial crisis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
441803700007,OPHTHALMIC SURGERY LASERS & IMAGING RETINA,Relationship Between Dry Retinal Volume and Visual Acuity in Diabetic Macular Edema,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between a novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) parameter, predicted dry retinal volume (DRV), and visual acuity (VA) in subjects with diabetic macular edema. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight eyes of 26 subjects with macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy (cases) and 10 healthy eyes of normal volunteers (controls) were included. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volume scans (512 x 128) were obtained before and 6 months to 12 months after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. The borders of the neurosensory retina, nerve fiber layer (NFL), and vitreous were manually defined using previously described grading software. NFL reflectivity was used to normalize the signal between eyes, allowing a normalized total retinal intensity to be computed for each eye by summing the brightness of every pixel in the retina on all B-scans. Using this normalized retinal intensity, a ratio of retinal intensity of cases over retinal intensity of normal was generated. The predicted DRV was computed by multiplying this calculated ratio with total retinal volume at baseline for each eye. Correlation analysis was performed between DRV at baseline and VA at baseline and final follow-up. RESULTS: The mean +/- standard deviation age of the cohort was 69 years +/- 9.8 years, and 28% were female. Mean best-corrected VA (logMAR) improved from 0.56 +/- 0.36 at baseline to 0.44 +/- 0.32 at follow-up (P = .001). The uncorrected (""wet"") total retinal volume of 13.25 mm(3) +/- 2.73 mm(3) at baseline declined significantly to a posttreatment retinal volume of 10.92 mm(3) +/- 1.42 mm(3). The predicted DRV (10.79 mm(3) +/- 1.42 mm(3)) was statistically similar to the post-treatment, actual retinal volume. No significant correlation was observed between DRV and post-treatment VA. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted DRV at baseline showed good agreement with the actual observed posttreatment retinal volume. Thus, DRV may be a potentially useful parameter to estimate the extent of retinal tissue loss that may be obscured by the presence of concomitant edema. The lack of correlation between DRV and VA, however, suggests that other parameters, such as the integrity of the outer retinal bands, are likely important for visual outcome prediction."
425147300013,JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN,Temperature Ddependence of Anomalous Hall Conductivity in Rashba-type Ferromagnets,"We theoretically investigated the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of Rashba-type ferromagnets at a finite temperature, taking into account spin fluctuation. We observed that the intrinsic AHC increases with increasing temperature. This can be understood from the characteristic nature of the spin chirality in the k-space, which increases with decreasing exchange splitting (EXS) when the spin-orbit interaction is much smaller than the EXS. The extrinsic part of the AHC also increases with temperature owing to the enhancement of the scattering strength of electrons due to the thermal fluctuation of the exchange field."
